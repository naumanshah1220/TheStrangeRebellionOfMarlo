## Story Context
The Purge List. Marlo receives a case about a clerk who delayed a "relocation" list. Among the 47 names: "DASHEV, M." — crossed out with the annotation "retain — still useful." Marlo's own name was on a purge list. He is alive because someone decided he was useful, not because he is safe.

## Synopsis
A routine Dereliction case arrives: a mid-level bureaucrat, Stefan Novak, allegedly failed to process required paperwork on time. But the "paperwork" is a list of 47 citizens approved for "relocation" — and Stefan delayed processing it for 11 days by misfiling it as "pending verification" because he recognized names on it. Friends. Neighbors. A teacher. A market vendor. A nurse.

Among the names is "DASHEV, M. — Pattern Bureau" — crossed out, with a handwritten note: "retain — still useful." Three other names have similar annotations: "retain — family leverage," "retain — informant," "retain — compliant." The Council doesn't just kill — it sorts people into categories: useful, expendable, and leverage.

## Suspects
- **Stefan Novak** — Administrative Clerk. Guilty (of Dereliction — he delayed the list by 11 days). Haunted, exhausted, acting on conscience. He knew what the list meant and stalled. Quietly heroic. Professional-class speech, careful.
- **Director Ivana Babic** — Stefan's supervisor. Not charged, but pushing for Stefan's conviction. She signed the original order and expedited it when the delay was discovered. Cold, institutional, treats the list as routine paperwork. Professional-class speech bordering on elite register.
- **Courier Dragan Simic** — The courier who was supposed to deliver the list to the Recalibration facility. Innocent. He never received it because Stefan intercepted it. Worker-class speech, cooperative.

## Evidence
- **The Relocation List** — Type: Document. 47 names with addresses and scheduled dates. Hotspot: Marlo's name crossed out (clue_marlo_on_list). Hotspot: "retain — still useful" annotation (clue_retain_note). Hotspot: three other "retain" annotations with different categories (clue_retain_categories). Hotspot: known community figures on the list — teachers, a market vendor, a nurse (clue_community_names).
- **Processing Delay Report** — Type: Document. Shows Stefan sat on the list for 11 days. Hotspot: delay duration (clue_delay_duration). Hotspot: Stefan's handwritten note "verify authorization" — a reasonable bureaucratic action (clue_verification_request).
- **Authorization Chain** — Type: Document. Who ordered the list. Hotspot: authorization traces back to Third Councilor Radovanovic's office (clue_councilor_authorization). Hotspot: no individual signatures — "standing directive" cited (clue_standing_directive).

## Key Clues (discovery chain)
1. clue_marlo_on_list — Marlo's own name on a purge list. Deeply personal.
2. clue_retain_note — Someone decided Marlo was "still useful."
3. clue_retain_categories — The Council sorts people: "useful," "leverage," "informant," "compliant."
4. clue_community_names — The list includes teachers, shopkeepers, nurses — ordinary people.
5. clue_delay_duration — Stefan delayed 11 days.
6. clue_verification_request — Stefan tried to verify authorization (a reasonable action).
7. clue_councilor_authorization — Third Councilor Radovanovic ordered the list.
8. clue_standing_directive — No individual accountability — it's "policy."
9. clue_stefan_conscience — From interrogation. Stefan explains why he delayed.

## Interrogation Flow
### Stefan Novak
- Tag: clue_delay_duration → Truth. "Yes. Eleven days. I know." Normal.
- Tag: clue_verification_request → Truth. "I requested verification because the authorization was irregular. No specific signatures. A 'standing directive' is not a name." Normal.
- Tag: clue_community_names → Truth. "Marta Rezek from the market. Teacher Kolar from Block C. The nurse who delivered my son. These are people, not paperwork." Emotional. → clue_stefan_conscience (clickable: "These are people")
- Tag: clue_marlo_on_list → Truth. "You saw your name? Then you understand why I hesitated." Emotional.
- Tag: clue_councilor_authorization → Truth. "It came from Radovanovic's office. 'Standing directive.' No name attached. As if that makes it acceptable." Defensive.
- Tag: clue_stefan_conscience → Truth. "I delayed it because I'm a human being. If that's a Deviation, then yes — I deviated." Emotional.
  - High stress: "What will you do, analyst? Process this list? Process ME? While your own name is on the page?" Emotional.

### Director Ivana Babic
- Tag: clue_delay_duration → Truth (cold). "Eleven days is unacceptable. Relocation schedules are time-sensitive. Processing efficiency is my responsibility, analyst. Not the content." Normal.
- Tag: clue_community_names → Lie. "The identities on the list are irrelevant to the processing failure." Normal.
- Tag: clue_marlo_on_list → Lie. "I'm not aware of specific names. I oversee administrative compliance, not list contents." Evasive.
- Tag: clue_councilor_authorization → Truth (bureaucratic). "Standing directives from the Council require no additional verification. Mr. Novak's delay was unauthorized." Normal.
- Tag: clue_verification_request → Lie. "His request for verification was itself a form of Dereliction. The authorization was valid." Defensive.
  - High stress: "These are administrative matters. Your role is to determine if the Deviation occurred. It did. The Pattern provides." Hostile.

### Courier Dragan Simic
- Tag: clue_delay_duration → Truth. "I never received the list. I was waiting at the distribution office. Nobody told me it was delayed." Normal.
- All responses Normal, cooperative.

## Verdict
- **Correct answer:** Stefan Novak committed Deviation: Dereliction (failure to process)
- **Accepted violations:** dereliction, obstruction, failure_to_process, insubordination
- **Partial credit:** None
- **Min confidence:** 60

## State/Resistance Paths
- **State path:** Convict Stefan. The list is processed. 47 people are sent to Recalibration.
- **Resistance path:** Stefan delayed the list. Some of those people may still be reachable. The Resistance can warn them.

## Narrative Hooks
- Marlo's name on the purge list is the most personally threatening moment in the game
- "Still useful" implies someone in the Council sees Marlo as an asset — but for how long?
- The "retain" categories reveal the Council's sorting system: useful, expendable, leverage
- Stefan asks the question the player must answer: "What will you do while your own name is on the page?"
- Stefan's moral courage contrasts with the bureaucratic machinery
- Director Babic's "Processing efficiency is my responsibility, not the content" is the banality of evil
- The list traces to Councilor Radovanovic's office — the corruption arc converges
- Convicting Stefan means 47 people are processed for Recalibration
