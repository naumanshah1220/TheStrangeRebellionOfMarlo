## Story Context
An anonymous tip that may be genuine civic duty or a personal vendetta. The player must assess credibility. Parallels the False Accuser case (core_03).

## Synopsis
An anonymous complaint accuses citizen Gordana Lazic of "expressing public dissatisfaction with ration quality" in the Block C market. Gordana allegedly said the bread was "stale" and "not fit for dogs." Under §4 (Discontent), criticizing Council provisions is a Deviation.

But multiple witnesses say Gordana said nothing of the sort. The anonymous tipster appears to be her ex-husband, Dragan Simic, who has a custody dispute pending.

## Suspects
- **Gordana Lazic** — Factory Worker. Innocent (the complaint is fabricated). Bewildered, angry, defensive. Worker-class speech.
- **Dragan Simic** — Her ex-husband (identified through the investigation). Guilty (of filing a false report). Worker-class speech, evasive.

## Evidence
- **Anonymous Complaint** — Type: Document. Detailed accusation. Hotspot: specific phrasing that reveals personal knowledge (clue_personal_phrasing).
- **Market Witness Statements** — Type: Document. Three witnesses. Hotspot: all say Gordana said nothing unusual (clue_witness_denial). Hotspot: one witness identifies a man fitting Dragan's description filing the complaint (clue_tipster_description).

## Verdict
- **Correct answer:** Dragan Simic committed Deviation: Discontent / false reporting (if discovered), or Gordana if the investigation doesn't dig deep
- **Accepted violations:** discontent, false_reporting, malicious_complaint
- **Min confidence:** 65

## Narrative Hooks
- Demonstrates how the Pattern is weaponized in personal disputes
- Parallels the False Accuser case (core_03) with a domestic angle
