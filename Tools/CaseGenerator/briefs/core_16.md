## Story Context
Concrete proof of systematic Council financial fraud. Two versions of the same Block D Infrastructure Fund report exist. Fingerprint analysis places the clerk on the altered document. All 12 changes benefit the same unlisted account. The altered documents trace directly to Councilor Radovanovic.

Last major evidence-gathering case before Act 4 escalates dramatically.

## Synopsis
An audit of the Block D Infrastructure Fund (connected to Day 15 and Day 16 cases) has produced two versions of the same financial report: the original (which Sonja Petrovic copied before she was arrested) and the current official version. Numbers have been changed — block fund allocations reduced, "administrative fees" added, totals adjusted. All 12 changes benefit the same unlisted account.

Fingerprint analysis of the altered document reveals prints matching Senior Clerk Branimir Tomic. His admission: "I was instructed to make those adjustments. By my superiors."

## Suspects
- **Branimir Tomic** — Senior Finance Clerk. Guilty (of altering documents). Methodical, cold, treats everything as paperwork. Lies smoothly using procedure as a shield. Only breaks under overwhelming evidence. Professional-class speech — bureaucratic.
- **Auditor Maja Horvat** — Original auditor. Innocent. Nervous but helpful. She audited properly; someone altered her work afterward. Professional-class speech, precise.

## Evidence
- **Original Financial Report** — Type: Document. Sonja's preserved copy. Hotspot: original allocation figures (clue_original_numbers). Hotspot: original total matching legitimate funds (clue_original_total).
- **Altered Financial Report** — Type: Document. Current official version. Hotspot: changed allocation figures (clue_altered_numbers). Hotspot: new "administrative fees" column (clue_admin_fees).
- **Fingerprint Analysis Card** — Type: Item. Prints from altered document. Hotspot: prints matching Branimir Tomic (clue_branimir_prints). Hotspot: prints matching Maja (routine — she's the auditor) (clue_maja_prints).
- **Document Comparison** — Type: Document. Side-by-side differences. Hotspot: 12 specific changes (clue_changes_count). Hotspot: all changes benefit the same unlisted account (clue_beneficiary_account).

## Key Clues (discovery chain)
1. clue_original_numbers — The real allocation figures.
2. clue_original_total — What the fund should look like.
3. clue_altered_numbers — The falsified figures.
4. clue_admin_fees — Fabricated fees covering the diversion.
5. clue_branimir_prints — Physical proof Branimir handled the altered document.
6. clue_maja_prints — Maja's prints on both (routine).
7. clue_changes_count — 12 deliberate changes — not a typo.
8. clue_beneficiary_account — All changes benefit the same unlisted account (Councilor Radovanovic's).
