## Story Context
THE central revelation. A disc recovered from a Resistance safe house contains a 40-year-old audio recording of Founding Council members designing the Pattern. They explicitly discuss which human behaviors to criminalize, how to frame them as moral failings, and how to ensure every citizen is perpetually guilty. One voice calls the Pattern "a useful fiction." The disc belonged to Vesna/Sonja's grandmother — a Founding Council member who recorded it as insurance.

## Synopsis
A case file arrives concerning a disc recovered during a raid on a suspected Resistance safe house. The disc contains an audio recording of what appears to be a Founding Council session from approximately 80 years ago. Three voices discuss the design of the Pattern: which human behaviors to criminalize, how to frame them as moral failings, how to ensure every citizen is perpetually vulnerable to prosecution.

The disc was originally in the possession of Sonja Dragojevic's grandmother — a Founding Council member who recorded it as insurance. The charge is against the person who held the disc most recently: a young Resistance courier named Andrej Radin — Pyotr's contact, connecting the personal and political arcs. Surname "Radin" — connected to Marlo's extended family network through Lenka's maiden name.

## Suspects
- **Andrej Radin** — Courier / Student. Guilty (of possessing classified material). Young, idealistic, scared. He was delivering the disc on Vesna's (Sonja Dragojevic's) orders. Knows the content is explosive but doesn't fully understand the implications. Worker-class speech, direct and emotional.
- **No second suspect** — The case is about the disc's content more than the courier.

## Evidence
- **The Confession Disc** — Type: Disc. Audio recording. associatedAppId: "audio_player". Hotspot (via computer): Voice 1 saying "We need crimes flexible enough to apply to anyone" (clue_flexible_crimes). Hotspot: Voice 2 saying "Call them sins. People accept divine punishment easier than arbitrary law" (clue_sins_framing). Hotspot: Voice 3 saying "The Pattern is a useful fiction" (clue_useful_fiction).
- **Disc Chain of Custody** — Type: Document. How the disc traveled from the Dragojevic family estate through Resistance channels to Andrej. Hotspot: Sonja Dragojevic's grandmother identified as original recorder (clue_dragojevic_origin). Hotspot: disc was hidden for nearly 80 years (clue_hidden_decades).
- **Andrej's Courier Instructions** — Type: Document. Sealed note from Vesna Cernak to Andrej. Hotspot: instructions to deliver disc to a Bureau-adjacent contact (clue_delivery_target). Hotspot: Vesna's coded signature (clue_vesna_signature).

## Key Clues (discovery chain)
1. clue_flexible_crimes — The Founding Council designed Pattern violations to be deliberately vague.
2. clue_sins_framing — The religious/moral framing was a conscious choice for social control.
3. clue_useful_fiction — A Council member explicitly calls the Pattern a useful fiction.
4. clue_dragojevic_origin — The disc belonged to Sonja Dragojevic's grandmother, a Founding Council member.
5. clue_hidden_decades — The recording has been hidden for nearly 80 years.
6. clue_delivery_target — The disc was being delivered to someone near the Bureau.
7. clue_vesna_signature — Vesna Cernak (Sonja Dragojevic) directed the courier.
8. clue_pattern_manufactured — From interrogation. Andrej explains what the Resistance believes.

## Interrogation Flow
### Andrej Radin
- Tag: clue_flexible_crimes → Truth. "Listen to it yourself. They sat in a room and DESIGNED the crimes. Every Tenet, every Deviation — manufactured." Emotional.
- Tag: clue_sins_framing → Truth. "They chose the seven sins because religion makes people obedient. 'Divine law' — except there's nothing divine about it." Emotional. → clue_pattern_manufactured (clickable: "nothing divine about it")
- Tag: clue_useful_fiction → Truth. "A useful fiction. Those are their exact words. The Pattern is a lie, and the people who wrote it knew it." Emotional.
- Tag: clue_delivery_target → Lie (protective). "I don't know who I was supposed to deliver it to. I just follow route instructions." Evasive.
  - Contradiction: Present clue_vesna_signature → "Vesna told me it needed to reach someone who could use it. Someone in the Bureau. I think she meant you." Emotional.
- Tag: clue_dragojevic_origin → Truth. "Sonja's grandmother was there at the beginning. She recorded it as insurance. She died before she could use it. The Dragojevic family kept it hidden until the purge." Emotional.
- Tag: clue_vesna_signature → Truth. "Yes. Vesna Cernak. Sonja Dragojevic. She's real. The Resistance is real. And so is that recording." Emotional.
  - High stress: "You've heard the tape. You know the truth now. What are you going to do with it?" Emotional.

## Verdict
- **Correct answer:** Andrej Radin committed Deviation: Accumulation (possession of classified recordings)
- **Accepted violations:** accumulation, sedition, unauthorized_possession
- **Partial credit:** None
- **Min confidence:** 60

## State/Resistance Paths
- **State path:** The disc is "fabricated Resistance propaganda." Convict Andrej. Destroy the disc.
- **Resistance path:** The disc is genuine evidence that the Pattern is manufactured. It changes everything.

## Narrative Hooks
- THE central revelation of the entire game — the Pattern is a deliberate control mechanism
- "I think she meant you" — Vesna/Sonja has been steering events toward Marlo
- Andrej Radin connects to Pyotr (Lenka's brother) — personal and political fully merge
- The disc content provides the philosophical backbone for the Act 5 choice
- The Computer tool (disc reader) is required — mechanical variety in a critical story moment
- The Dragojevic grandmother was a Founding Council member who recorded as insurance
- "A useful fiction" — three words that unravel 80 years of civic doctrine
- Connects directly to the Four Layers of Truth: this is the Layer 2 revelation
