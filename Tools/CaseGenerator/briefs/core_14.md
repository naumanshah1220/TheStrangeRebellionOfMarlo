## Story Context
Whistleblower is the suspect. A government accountant discovered the same 47,000-mark diversion from Day 15 and filed an internal report. Two weeks later SHE was charged with Discontent and Accumulation. Pyotr Radin's name appears in the fund access list — connecting the political arc to Marlo's family.

## Synopsis
Sonja Petrovic, a government accountant in Sector 3, discovered 47,000 marks diverted from Block D infrastructure to an unlisted account. She filed an internal report. Two weeks later she was charged with Discontent (§4) — "questioning the Council's financial distribution" — and Accumulation (§2) for retaining copies of financial records. Her supervisor, Director Goran Lukic, says she "exceeded her authorization." The records include the name "P. Radin" — Pyotr, Lenka's brother.

## Suspects
- **Sonja Petrovic** — Government Accountant. Innocent (charge is retaliatory). Precise, meticulous, deeply anxious. She kept copies because she knew originals would disappear. Professional-class speech — numbers and facts.
- **Director Goran Lukic** — District Finance Director. Not charged but complicit in cover-up. Smooth, patronizing, uses "proper channels" language. Professional-class speech bordering on elite register.

## Evidence
- **Sonja's Financial Report** — Type: Document. Her analysis. Hotspot: specific amounts diverted (clue_fund_amounts). Hotspot: unlisted account destination (clue_unlisted_account).
- **Copied Financial Records** — Type: Document. Records Sonja retained. Hotspot: fund access list including "P. Radin" (clue_pyotr_connection). Hotspot: authorization signatures (clue_authorization_chain).
- **Internal Charge Sheet** — Type: Document. Charge against Sonja. Hotspot: filed by Director Lukic (clue_lukic_filed). Hotspot: double charge — Discontent AND Accumulation (clue_double_charge).

## Interrogation Flow
### Sonja Petrovic
- Tag: clue_fund_amounts → Truth. "47,000 marks over eight months. Documented to the penny." Normal.
- Tag: clue_unlisted_account → Truth. "The account doesn't appear in any public registry. I checked three times." Normal. → clue_sonja_defense (clickable: "checked three times")
- Tag: clue_double_charge → Truth. "They charged me with TWO Deviations for reporting their crime. The message is clear — don't look." Emotional.
- Tag: clue_lukic_filed → Truth. "Director Lukic approved every transfer I flagged. Of course he filed the charge against me." Defensive.
- Tag: clue_pyotr_connection → Truth (limited). "Radin? He's a courier. Delivers sealed envelopes between offices. I doubt he knows what's in them." Normal.
- Tag: clue_authorization_chain → Truth. "Transfers signed by three people. Lukic, a Council liaison, and someone whose signature I couldn't identify." Normal.

### Director Goran Lukic
- Tag: clue_fund_amounts → Lie. "Those figures are taken out of context. Interdepartment transfers are routine." Normal.
  - Contradiction: Present clue_unlisted_account → "The account is a classified Council reserve fund." Evasive.
- Tag: clue_lukic_filed → Lie. "She retained classified documents. That's standard procedure for reporting." Normal.
- Tag: clue_authorization_chain → Lie. "Transfer authorizations are confidential." Evasive.
  - Contradiction: Present clue_fund_amounts → "This is beyond your scope, analyst." Hostile. → clue_lukic_involvement (clickable: "beyond your scope")
- Tag: clue_pyotr_connection → Lie. "I don't discuss personnel matters." Evasive.

## Verdict
- **Correct answer:** Sonja Petrovic is INNOCENT
- **Accepted violations:** discontent, accumulation (system accepts wrongful conviction)
- **Partial credit:** None
- **Min confidence:** 65

## State/Resistance Paths
- **State path:** Convict Sonja. Accept the numbers are "classified."
- **Resistance path:** Sonja's evidence is real. The funds are being stolen. Pyotr is a thread that leads home.

## Narrative Hooks
- Pyotr's name brings the main arc into Marlo's personal sphere
- Sonja parallels Henrik Petrov (Day 11) — punished for doing her job
- The unlisted account connects to Councilor Radovanovic's enrichment
- "Beyond your scope" becomes a recurring Council threat
- Connects directly to Day 15 (construction fund fraud) and Day 18 (falsified audit)
