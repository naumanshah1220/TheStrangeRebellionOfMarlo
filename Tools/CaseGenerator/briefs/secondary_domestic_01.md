## Story Context
A noise complaint between neighbors. Simple, procedural, satisfying. Shows the everyday grind of Pattern enforcement alongside major cases.

## Synopsis
Building monitor Rada Zoric filed a complaint against her downstairs neighbor, Vladan Kolar, for persistent loud music after curfew. Vladan claims his radio is broken and stuck on one station. Building records show 4 complaints over 2 weeks.

The truth: Vladan's radio IS broken. He can't afford to fix it and is too proud to ask for help. The noise is real but unintentional.

## Suspects
- **Vladan Kolar** — Retired Factory Worker. Guilty (technically). Stubborn, hard of hearing, embarrassed about his poverty. Defensive but not hostile. Worker-class speech.
- **Rada Zoric** — Building Monitor. Innocent (complainant). By-the-book, slightly annoyed, just wants the noise to stop. Worker-class speech.

## Evidence
- **Complaint Log** — Type: Document. Four filed complaints. Hotspot: consistent timing (clue_consistent_timing). Hotspot: Rada's descriptions (clue_complaint_details).
- **Vladan's Repair Requests** — Type: Document. Unfiled maintenance requests. Hotspot: radio listed as needing repair (clue_broken_radio).

## Verdict
- **Correct answer:** Vladan Kolar committed Deviation: Agitation (noise violation)
- **Accepted violations:** agitation, noise_violation
- **Min confidence:** 65

## Narrative Hooks
- Humanizes the mundane side of Pattern enforcement
- Poverty as a root cause — a running theme
