## Story Context
A citizen accused of "excessive smiling" in a government building. Darkly funny. Critiques the system through absurdity.

## Synopsis
Building security at the Sector 3 Administrative Office reported citizen Dana Kovac for "displaying persistent, unjustified positive affect in a government facility." In plain language: she smiled too much. The security guard, a Pattern zealot, interpreted her cheerfulness as Elevation (§6) — "projecting superiority over fellow citizens through demonstrative happiness."

Dana is a dental hygienist who was there to file a routine form. She smiles because it's a professional habit.

## Suspects
- **Dana Kovac** — Dental Hygienist. Guilty (absurdly). Genuinely confused. She smiles at everyone. Cannot understand how this is a Deviation. Worker-class speech.
- **Guard Filip Novak** — Security Guard. Innocent (reporter). Dead serious about the charge. Quotes the Tenets like scripture. Worker-class speech, rigid.

## Evidence
- **Security Incident Report** — Type: Document. Guard's report. Hotspot: "persistent unjustified positive affect" (clue_excessive_smiling). Hotspot: "projecting superiority" language (clue_elevation_interpretation).
- **Witness Statement** — Type: Document. Other citizens present. Hotspot: witnesses say Dana was polite and normal (clue_witness_contradiction).

## Verdict
- **Correct answer:** Dana Kovac committed Deviation: Elevation (the system allows this absurd charge)
- **Accepted violations:** elevation, disruptive_behavior
- **Min confidence:** 55

## Narrative Hooks
- The most absurd case in the game — designed to make the player laugh and then feel sick
- Guard Novak represents the true believers who make the system work from the bottom
- "Unjustified positive affect" — a perfectly bureaucratic way to criminalize happiness
