## Meta
- **Type:** Core
- **Available Day:** 27
- **Sequence:** 23
- **Reward:** 100
- **Complexity:** Complex
- **Required Tools:** Document reading
- **Deviation:** Multiple — player-determined
- **Involves Resistance:** Yes

## Story Context
Penultimate case. Vesna Cernak has been captured. Her case file arrives at Marlo's desk. The Council dossier: intimidation, property destruction, recruiting civilians into danger. The Resistance counter-dossier: protecting 23 families from relocation, exposing real corruption, preserving the Confession Tape. Both sets of evidence are genuine — she IS guilty of everything. So is the Council.

If the player has earned enough Resistance Trust, evidence in the file reveals "Vesna Cernak" is actually Sonja Vlastimirova Dragojevic — daughter of the last Dragojevic patriarch, heir to the Seventh Seat.

## Synopsis
Vesna Cernak has been captured. Her case file arrives at Marlo's desk — by design (Terzic's replacement wants Marlo to process it, either as a loyalty test or a trap). The Council charges Vesna with multiple Deviations: Agitation, Accumulation, Dereliction, Deviance.

The Resistance sends a final coded message: "She has the evidence to end this. Help her and the recordings go public. Betray her and everything dies with her."

Both sides present evidence. The Council's evidence shows Vesna orchestrating violence, intimidating witnesses, and manipulating innocents. The Resistance evidence shows Vesna protecting civilians, exposing corruption, and preserving the Confession Tape. Both sets are genuine — Vesna has done all of these things.

**The Sonja reveal:** If the player has earned enough Resistance Trust, evidence in the file reveals "Vesna Cernak" is actually **Sonja Vlastimirova Dragojevic** — daughter of the last Dragojevic patriarch. Her font changes mid-conversation from sans-serif (worker) to cursive (elite). Visual shock before narrative understanding.

Her moral complexity: she's not just a freedom fighter — she may be restoring a dynasty. Does she want to destroy the system or reclaim her family's Seventh Seat?

## Suspects
- **Vesna Cernak / Sonja Dragojevic** — Resistance Leader. Age 41, former university professor. Guilty (of everything she's charged with, and more). Calm, brilliant, unflinching. She doesn't deny her actions — she contextualizes them. Every response is a philosophical argument. She's the most articulate suspect in the game. Worker-class speech (as Vesna) → Elite-class speech (as Sonja, after reveal).
- **No second suspect** — Vesna/Sonja is the sole focus. The case is about judgment, not investigation.

## Interrogation Flow
### Vesna Cernak / Sonja Dragojevic
- Tag: clue_intimidation_evidence → Truth. "Yes. I frightened people into silence to protect others. I'm not proud of it." Normal.
- Tag: clue_destruction_evidence → Truth. "I ordered the printing press destroyed when the Council was closing in. Better ashes than a trail." Normal.
- Tag: clue_manipulation_evidence → Truth. "I asked people to risk their lives. Some of them didn't come back. That's on me." Emotional.
- Tag: clue_protection_evidence → Truth. "I moved 23 families off the relocation list. That's also on me." Normal.
- Tag: clue_corruption_exposed → Truth. "The ration fraud. The fund diversion. The false flag bombing. All documented. All real." Normal.
- Tag: clue_tape_transcripts → Truth. "My grandmother recorded the Founding Council. They designed the Pattern in a conference room. Seven families making up seven Tenets to control a nation." Normal.
- Tag: clue_moral_compromise → Truth. "I'm not a saint, Analyst Dashev. I'm a person who decided that a corrupt system deserved to be fought, even if fighting it required compromise." Emotional.
- Tag: clue_direct_appeal → Truth. "You've processed enough cases to know. You've seen your own name on a purge list. You've heard the tape. The question isn't whether I'm guilty. The question is: what does 'guilty' even mean in a system built on lies?" Emotional.
  - High stress: "Whatever you decide, I accept. But know that your decision isn't just about me. It's about what kind of Drazhovia exists tomorrow." Emotional.
- Tag: clue_sonja_identity → Truth (if revealed). "Vesna Cernak was a name I chose to disappear. My name is Sonja Vlastimirova Dragojevic. My family wrote the Pact. My family tried to reform it. My family was destroyed for trying." Normal. (Font changes to cursive mid-response.)
- Tag: clue_family_connection → Truth (if revealed). "Maksimilian betrayed us. He sits in the Council knowing our family was purged. And someone just tried to kill him for the same conscience that destroyed us 15 years late." Emotional.

## Verdict
- **Correct answer:** Multiple valid outcomes depending on player's arc
- **Accepted violations:** agitation, accumulation, dereliction, deviance, sedition (any combination)
- **Partial credit:** Any verdict is "accepted" — the system doesn't distinguish justice from compliance
- **Min confidence:** 50

## State/Resistance Paths
- **State path:** Convict Vesna/Sonja on all charges. Council Favor maximized. The Resistance is dealt a fatal blow.
- **Resistance path:** Help Vesna/Sonja's evidence reach the public. Resistance Trust maximized. The Council faces exposure.

## Narrative Hooks
- This is the setup for the final verdict (Day 28)
- Vesna/Sonja's arguments synthesize every moral question from the entire game
- Her admission of moral compromise prevents her from being a simple hero
- The Sonja reveal recontextualizes the entire Resistance arc — is this freedom fighting or dynasty restoration?
- The font change from sans-serif to cursive is a visual shock — she was elite-class all along
- The direct appeal to Marlo breaks the fourth wall of the bureaucratic system — she treats him as a person, not an analyst
- "What does 'guilty' even mean in a system built on lies?" — the game's thesis question
- The verdict here determines which ending path is available
