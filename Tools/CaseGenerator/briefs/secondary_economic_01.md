Market inspector flagged vendor Sasha Kolar for selling homemade soap with unapproved ingredients. Under §2, manufacturing goods from unapproved materials is an Accumulation Deviation. The soap contains lavender oil — a "luxury botanical" restricted to Council-approved retailers.

Sasha has been making soap for years. Lavender grows wild behind her apartment. She didn't know it was restricted.
