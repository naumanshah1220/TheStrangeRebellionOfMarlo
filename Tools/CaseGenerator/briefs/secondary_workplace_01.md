## Story Context
A worker caught taking unauthorized breaks. Mundane horror of the quota system. Shows how the Pattern criminalizes basic human needs.

## Synopsis
Factory supervisor reports that worker Branko Jovic has been taking 15-minute unauthorized breaks every 2 hours, exceeding the permitted 10-minute break every 4 hours. Timecard records confirm the pattern.

The reason: Branko has a bladder condition. He has medical documentation but never submitted it through the "proper channels" (a 6-week process requiring 3 forms).

## Suspects
- **Branko Jovic** — Assembly Line Worker. Guilty (technically). Embarrassed about his medical condition. Quiet, resigned. Worker-class speech.
- **Supervisor Mirko Babic** — Shift Supervisor. Innocent (reporter). Frustrated but not malicious — quotas are his responsibility. Professional-class speech.

## Evidence
- **Timecard Records** — Type: Document. Break patterns documented. Hotspot: unauthorized break frequency (clue_break_pattern).
- **Medical Note** — Type: Document. Doctor's note about the condition. Hotspot: diagnosis confirming need for frequent breaks (clue_medical_condition).

## Verdict
- **Correct answer:** Branko Jovic committed Deviation: Dereliction (unauthorized breaks)
- **Accepted violations:** dereliction, quota_violation, unauthorized_absence
- **Min confidence:** 65

## Narrative Hooks
- The "6-week process requiring 3 forms" shows institutional dysfunction
- Medical exceptions don't exist under the Pattern
- The system doesn't accommodate basic human needs
