## Story Context
A jaywalking charge on someone who turns out to be a Resistance courier. The case seems trivial, but a detail in the evidence connects to the larger arc. Rewards attentive players.

## Synopsis
Citizen Nikola Radin (distant relation of Pyotr Radin, Lenka's brother) was cited for repeatedly crossing a street outside designated crosswalks near the Sector 5 warehouse district. The Pattern Enforcer documented three violations in one week.

Nikola claims he's a delivery courier and the designated crosswalk adds 10 minutes to each delivery, making it impossible to meet quotas. In his citation paperwork, his delivery log shows stops at an address that matches a Resistance safe house from a later core case.

## Suspects
- **Nikola Radin** — Delivery Courier. Guilty (of jaywalking). Harried, overworked, pragmatic. Treats this as a waste of everyone's time. Worker-class speech.

## Evidence
- **Citation Report** — Type: Document. Three jaywalking incidents. Hotspot: specific street locations (clue_jaywalking_locations).
- **Delivery Log** — Type: Document. Nikola's route. Hotspot: one delivery address matches an address mentioned in later cases (clue_suspicious_address).

## Verdict
- **Correct answer:** Nikola Radin committed Deviation: Agitation (jaywalking)
- **Accepted violations:** agitation, traffic_violation
- **Min confidence:** 60

## Narrative Hooks
- The delivery address is a Resistance safe house — but the player won't know this until later

- Demonstrates how the system criminalizes people trying to do their jobs efficiently
