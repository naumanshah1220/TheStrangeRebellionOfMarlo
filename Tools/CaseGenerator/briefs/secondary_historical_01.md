## Story Context
A cold case reopened. An old theft from 8 years ago — new fingerprint evidence surfaced. Limited information forces the player to work with fragments. A 72-year-old retired janitor stole a clock because it reminded him of his late wife. No statute of limitations.

## Synopsis
Eight years ago, a valuable clock was stolen from the Sector 2 Municipal Hall. The case went cold. During recent renovations, workers found the clock hidden in a sealed wall cavity along with a set of personal items. New fingerprint technology allows prints to be analyzed that couldn't be processed originally.

The prints match Branko Zelnik, a janitor who worked at Municipal Hall during the theft and retired 5 years ago. He's now 72 years old.

## Suspects
- **Branko Zelnik** — Retired Janitor. Guilty. Old, tired, doesn't deny it anymore. He took the clock because it reminded him of one his late wife owned. Nostalgic theft. Deep worker-class speech, sparse vocabulary.
