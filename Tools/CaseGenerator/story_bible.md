# The Strange Rebellion of Marlo — Story Bible

## SECTION 1: THE WORLD — The Republic of Drazhovia

### Geography & Setting
Drazhovia is a fictional Eastern European republic, landlocked between mountain ranges, isolated from the outside world by geography and policy. The capital, **Gradvice**, is a sprawling industrial city divided into numbered **Blocks** (residential/industrial districts) and **Sectors** (administrative zones).

The city feels like a cross between 1980s East Berlin and a Brutalist fever dream — concrete towers, narrow alleys, ration queues, loudspeaker poles on every corner broadcasting "The Pattern Hour" at 6 AM and 6 PM. Colors are muted: gray concrete, faded red banners, yellow streetlights. The only color comes from propaganda posters and the occasional black-market flower vendor.

**Key Locations:**
- **The Bureau of Pattern Compliance** — Where Marlo works. A gray monolith in Sector 1. Analysts sit at desks processing case files all day. Think DMV meets police precinct meets Kafka's Castle.
- **Block A through Block G** — Residential districts, ranked by loyalty. Block A is for Council-adjacent citizens. Block G is where "unreliables" are placed.
- **The Municipal Records Office** — Where government paperwork lives and dies. Andelka Horacek worked here.
- **The Council Hall** — Gleaming white building in Sector 0. Citizens never enter. Council members are rarely seen in public.
- **The Market District (Sector 5)** — Where ration cards are exchanged for goods. Occasional black market activity.
- **The Factory Quarter (Sector 9)** — Industrial zone. Quota-driven. Workers here are expendable.
- **The Relay Tower** — Communications hub. Resistanz wants access. Council guards it heavily.

### Climate
Perpetual overcast. Rain three days out of five. Snow from November through March. The weather matches the mood.

### Technology Level
1980s analog with selective modern tech. No internet. Computers exist but are state-controlled — the Bureau uses them for database lookups. Citizens have no personal computers. Phones are landlines only, monitored. Television broadcasts state-approved content only. The spectrograph and fingerprint duster represent "cutting-edge" Bureau technology — privileges earned through loyalty.

## SECTION 2: THE PATTERN — The Seven Tenets of Civic Harmony

### Origin (Public Version)
The Pattern was established 80 years ago by the **Founding Council** after "The Collapse" — a catastrophe the Council claims destroyed the old world through moral decay. The seven Tenets codify the natural law of civic harmony.

### Origin (Layer 2 Truth — revealed Act 3)
The Founding Council studied behavioral psychology and designed the Tenets to ensure every citizen is perpetually guilty of something. The genius: the violations are vague enough to apply to anyone. Everyone can be charged with Surplus (do you have more than your neighbor?) or Discontent (did you sigh too loudly?). Permanent vulnerability ensures permanent compliance.

### The Seven Tenets

The violations are called **Tenets** — positive-sounding principles enforced negatively. Breaking a Tenet is called a **Deviation**. Citizens don't commit crimes; they "deviate from the Tenet."

| # | Tenet (Positive) | Deviation (Violation) | Old Name | Official Text |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| §1 | Sufficiency | Surplus | Excess/Gluttony | "Take only your measure. To want more is to steal from all." |
| §2 | Release | Accumulation | Possession/Greed | "Hold nothing beyond need. Surplus is suspicion." |
| §3 | Service | Dereliction | Obstruction/Sloth | "Every hand serves the whole. The idle hand is an enemy." |
| §4 | Gratitude | Discontent | Ingratitude/Envy | "Accept your allocation. Comparison is corrosion." |
| §5 | Composure | Agitation | Disruption/Wrath | "Restraint is strength. Anger is a weapon; its possession is a crime." |
| §6 | Humility | Elevation | Vanity/Pride | "No one rises above. Individual distinction threatens collective unity." |
| §7 | Purity | Deviance | Corruption/Lust | "All bonds require registration. Unregistered bonds are void." |

**Usage in dialogue:** "She deviated from the Second Tenet" or "Charged with Deviation: Surplus" or simply "a Surplus charge."

### The Tenet Litany
Recited at Pattern Hour (6 AM and 6 PM loudspeaker broadcasts) and official events:
> "I am sufficient. I release. I serve. I am grateful. I am composed. I am humble. I am pure. The Pattern provides."

### Enforcement
- **Pattern Analysts** (like Marlo) process cases at the Bureau
- **Pattern Enforcers** are the police who bring in suspects and evidence
- **Overseers** are senior Council agents who monitor analysts and guide priorities
- **Judicial** handles sentencing (off-screen — Marlo only processes and indicts)

### The Full Text of Each Tenet

**§1 — Sufficiency (Surplus)**
"No citizen shall consume, use, or expend resources beyond their allocated means. Take only your measure. To want more is to steal from all."

**§2 — Release (Accumulation)**
"No citizen shall accumulate goods, knowledge, capital, or influence beyond what is necessary for their assigned civic role. Hold nothing beyond need. Surplus is suspicion."

**§3 — Service (Dereliction)**
"Every citizen owes labor to the collective. Every hand serves the whole. Failure to meet assigned quotas, deliberate underperformance, or sabotage through inaction constitutes dereliction. The idle hand is an enemy."

**§4 — Gratitude (Discontent)**
"No citizen shall covet another's allocation, question the fairness of distribution, or express dissatisfaction with the Pattern's provisions. Accept your allocation. Comparison is corrosion."

**§5 — Composure (Agitation)**
"Acts of aggression, public disturbance, emotional excess, or behavior threatening civic harmony are prohibited. Restraint is strength. Anger is a weapon; its possession is a crime."

**§6 — Humility (Elevation)**
"No citizen shall promote themselves above their station, claim superiority over fellow citizens, or pursue ambition without Council approval. No one rises above. Individual distinction threatens collective unity."

**§7 — Purity (Deviance)**
"Unauthorized intimate relations, deviation from approved social bonds, or moral degeneracy undermine the social fabric. All bonds require registration. Unregistered bonds are void and criminal."

## SECTION 3: FACTIONS

### The Council
The ruling body of Drazhovia. Seven members matching the seven Tenets (intentional symbolism). Citizens know them only by number: First through Seventh.

**What they want:** Maintain power. The Pattern keeps citizens compliant. Any threat to the Pattern threatens them.

**How they operate:** Through bureaucracy. The Council doesn't dirty its hands — it issues directives, and the machine complies. Overseers carry instructions. Analysts process cases. Enforcers arrest. The Judicial sentences. Everyone is "just doing their job."

**Their hypocrisy:** Council members routinely violate every Tenet. They feast (Surplus), accumulate wealth (Accumulation), delegate all work (Dereliction), compare status (Discontent), rage at subordinates (Agitation), promote themselves (Elevation), and maintain secret relationships (Deviance). The cases in Acts 3-4 gradually expose this.

**Never seen publicly.** Communicate through Overseers, directives, and Pattern Hour broadcasts.

**The Masks:** On rare public occasions (Pattern Day, the annual Reaffirmation Ceremony), Council members appear wearing porcelain masks depicting the seven Tenet symbols. They speak through voice modulators.

**The Succession Secret:** Officially "chosen by the Pattern itself" through merit. In reality: all 7 seats held by the same 7 founding families for 80 years. Hereditary succession — father to son, mother to daughter. The families intermarry. The "merit selection" is theater.

**The Seventh Seat:** Vacant since the Dragojevic purge 15 years ago. The Pact says all 7 must be filled for the Pattern to be "complete." Internal tension: some believe the Pattern is weakening.

**Council Members (The Seven):**
1. **Dobroslav Vitomirovic** — First Councilor (Chairman). Only one who has read the complete Pact.
2. **Aleksandra Moravska-Grod** — Second Councilor. Hyphenated aristocracy.
3. **Konstantin Radovanovic** — Third Councilor (Internal Security). Primary antagonist. The most powerful and corrupt Council member. Personally responsible for the ration-skimming scheme. Never seen, only felt through influence.
4. **Vitomir Zoroslav** — Fourth Councilor (Information).
5. **Maksimilian Dragojevic** — Fifth Councilor. Survived the purge by betraying his own family. Sonja's cousin. Sits in the Council knowing his family was destroyed.
6. **Teodora Kazimirski** — Sixth Councilor.
7. **Seventh seat vacant** — The Dragojevic line's seat.

### The Resistanz
An underground resistance movement led by **Vesna Cernak** (public identity) / **Sonja Vlastimirova Dragojevic** (true identity). The Resistanz is not a heroic rebel alliance. They are desperate, pragmatic, and morally gray.

**What they want:** Expose the Pattern as manufactured oppression. Ideally, dismantle the Council. Pragmatically, survive and spread truth.

**How they operate:** Through information. They collect evidence of Council hypocrisy, distribute pamphlets, and recruit sympathizers in key positions. They approach Marlo because an analyst who processes cases has access to damning evidence.

**Their moral ambiguity:** The Resistanz isn't above manipulation. They will lie to Marlo, use him, and sacrifice individuals for the cause. Vesna/Sonja is charismatic but ruthless — she'll ask Marlo to convict innocent people if it serves the larger strategy.

"Vesna" is a common worker name, invisible as "Jane Smith." She has READ THE PACT — she knows the true history, making her the most dangerous person in Drazhovia.

**Symbols:** The Resistanz uses a broken circle (the "unpattern") as their symbol. Messages are hidden in the margins of pamphlets, inside evidence files, or encoded in radio static.

### The Bureau of Pattern Compliance
Marlo's workplace. Not a faction per se, but an institution with its own culture. Analysts compete for promotions. Overseers play favorites. The Bureau rewards efficiency (cases closed per day) over accuracy. This creates pressure to convict quickly, even when evidence is thin.

**Bureau motto:** "Silence is order." On walls, documents, stamps. Institutional.

## SECTION 4: CHARACTERS

### Marlo Dashev — The Player Character
- **Age:** 34
- **Background:** Former schoolteacher. Recruited to the Bureau two years ago after his school was shut down for "curriculum irregularities." The Bureau offered stable pay, rations for his family, and an apartment upgrade from Block E to Block C.
- **Family:** Wife Lenka, son Eli (8), daughter Katya (5)
- **"Marlo"** is unusual in Drazhovia — implies parents were slightly unconventional
- **Personality:** Methodical, quiet, observant. Not political — he took the Bureau job for survival, not ideology. Whether he becomes a loyal analyst or a secret dissident is up to the player.
- **Internal conflict:** Marlo genuinely believes in order and safety. He's not anti-government by nature. The game forces him to confront what happens when "order" becomes oppression.

### Lenka Dashev — Wife (nee Radin)
- **Age:** 32
- **Background:** Nurse at Block C clinic. Pragmatic and loving. Her letters are the player's emotional anchor.
- **Arc:** Letters start warm and domestic (Days 1-6), become worried (Days 7-12), then frightened (Days 13-19), then desperate (Days 20-26), and finally resolute (Days 27-30).
- **Key moment:** Day 15, she mentions her brother Pyotr has "gotten involved with some people." This is the Resistanz thread entering the personal sphere.

### Pyotr Radin — Lenka's Brother
- **Age:** 28
- **Background:** Factory worker in Sector 9. Hot-headed, idealistic. Takes Lenka's maiden name (Radin). Has been secretly attending Resistanz meetings.
- **Role:** Pyotr becomes a narrative pressure point. The Council may use him as leverage against Marlo. The Resistanz may use him as a messenger. His fate depends on player choices.
- **Appears:** Referenced in letters from Day 6 onward. Physically appears in a case around Day 16.

### Overseer V. Terzic — Marlo's Handler
- **Full name:** Vlastimir Terzic — never offers first name, signs as "V. Terzic"
- **Age:** ~50s
- **Background:** Senior Overseer, personally assigned to monitor Marlo's sector. Communicates through typed letters on Bureau letterhead.
- **Personality:** Paternalistic and menacing in equal measure. Early letters praise Marlo's work. Mid-game letters suggest "focusing on the right suspects." Late-game letters are thinly veiled threats.
- **True nature:** Colonel Terzic, Military Intelligence. Has been curating Marlo's caseload. Day 24 case reveals his identity and crimes.
- **Arc:** Starts as mentor figure, becomes antagonist.

### Vesna Cernak / Sonja Dragojevic — Resistanz Leader
- **Age:** 41
- **Public identity:** "Vesna Cernak" — worker-class name, invisible
- **True identity:** Sonja Vlastimirova Dragojevic — daughter of the last Dragojevic patriarch
- **Background:** Former university professor of political philosophy. Went underground 15 years ago after the Dragojevic purge.
- **Personality:** Calm, articulate, calculating. She speaks like a teacher explaining a lesson — patient but firm. She genuinely believes she's fighting for the greater good, but her methods are questionable.
- **Has read the Pact.** Knows the true history of the Collapse.
- **Moral complexity:** She's not just a freedom fighter — she's restoring a dynasty. Does she want to destroy the system or reclaim her family's Seventh Seat?
- **Font mechanic:** When "Vesna" is revealed as Sonja Dragojevic, her text font changes from sans-serif (worker) to cursive (elite) mid-conversation. Visual shock before narrative understanding.
- **First appears:** Day 13 (indirect — coded message in evidence). Day 21 (through coded message). Day 27 (directly in her own case file).
- **Moral ambiguity:** Sonja has ordered Resistanz members to commit crimes — planting evidence, intimidating witnesses, even framing innocents — to advance her goals. She would argue the ends justify the means.

### Councilor Radovanovic — The Antagonist
- **Title:** Third Councilor (Internal Security)
- **Full name:** Konstantin Radovanovic
- **Age:** 60s
- **Background:** The most powerful and corrupt Council member. Personally responsible for the ration-skimming scheme exposed in Case 1. Has been diverting resources to build a personal estate outside the city.
- **Personality:** Never seen, only felt through his influence. Cases that threaten him get "redirected." Witnesses disappear. Evidence goes missing.
- **Role:** The systemic evil the player gradually uncovers. Not a mustache-twirling villain — just a powerful person who has decided other people's lives are less important than his comfort.

### Key Recurring Citizens (appear across multiple cases)

**Viktor Sevorin** — Block A bureaucrat. Appears as a witness in multiple cases. Nervously cooperative. Actually a Council informant planted to monitor the Bureau from inside.

**Marta Rezek** — Market vendor in Sector 5. Appears as a suspect/witness in secondary cases. Knows everyone, sees everything. Secretly sympathetic to the Resistanz.

**Officer Dusek** — Pattern Enforcer who brings in suspects. Professional, by-the-book. Privately disgusted by some of the cases he's ordered to pursue. Potential ally in Act 4.

**Dr. Yara Petrovic** — Bureau medical examiner / forensics. Provides spectrograph and fingerprint analysis context. Sardonic, detached. Knows more than she lets on.

**Branko Zelnik** — Retired janitor, deep working class. Appears in secondary historical case.

## SECTION 5: RITUAL PHRASES & CLASS-BASED LANGUAGE

### Ritual Greetings & Phrases

| Phrase | Response | Context |
|---|---|---|
| "The Pattern provides." | "And we are provided for." | Standard citizen greeting/farewell. Like "Under His Eye." |
| "The Pattern is whole." | "And we are its parts." | Formal state greeting — ceremonies, Council directives, official occasions. |
| "Steady, citizen." | "Steady." | Informal worker greeting. Implies: stay calm, don't deviate. |
| "Stay in the trace." | "Never to stray." | **Bureau morning ritual.** What analysts say before starting work. "Trace" = evidence trail AND "stay in your lane." |
| "Count your blessings." | "They are numbered." | **Overseer dismissal/warning.** Chilling double meaning: "numbered" = quantified AND running out. |
| "Silence is order." | — | **Bureau motto.** On walls, documents, stamps. Institutional. |
| "Debts are paid." | "Balance is peace." | **Economic/penalty context.** Bill collectors, Night Summary, state demands for payment. |
| "Walk in measure." | "In measure." | Farewell. Stay within your allocated boundaries. |
| "For the Collective." | — | Document sign-off and formal speech. |
| "By the Tenets." | — | Oath/affirmation when making official statements. |

### Class-Based Speech Patterns

**Council/Elite** (Cursive font in-game):
- Full sentences, literary vocabulary, never slang
- Reference "the founders," "the ancient wisdom," "the Pact's guidance"
- Passive voice: "It has been determined" not "I decided"
- Address others by full title: "Analyst Dashev" not "Marlo"
- Euphemisms for violence: "recalibration," "civic adjustment," "the process"

**Bureau/Professional** (Serif font):
- Bureaucratic jargon, clinical detachment
- "Deviation: Surplus §1" not "they're greedy"
- Abbreviations: "DevSurp" (Deviation: Surplus), "RecCal" (Recalibration)
- Measured, careful — they know they're being evaluated

**Workers/Citizens** (Sans-serif font):
- Direct, simple vocabulary
- Pattern slang: "got measured" (arrested), "running hot" (about to deviate on Agitation), "quiet hands" (rule-follower), "the hum" (daily routine)
- Shortened greetings: "Pattern provides" (dropping "The")
- Gallows humor about the system but never openly critical

**Unreliables / Block G** (Rough monospace font):
- Street slang, deliberately subversive vocabulary
- "Tenners" (enforcers), "patternized" (brainwashed), "the sweep" (recalibration), "glasswalker" (someone who lives transparently — insult for conformists)
- Made-up compound words (inverted Newspeak — the underclass creates language to resist, not comply)
- Drop ritual greetings entirely — refusing to say "The Pattern provides" is a quiet act of rebellion

### Naming Class Rules (for the generator)

- **Council/Elite:** Full formal names, 3 parts (first + patronymic + surname). Never shortened. Compound archaic first names (Vlastimir, Dobroslav, Zorislava). Surname endings: -ovic, -ski, hyphenated.
- **Professional class:** Shortened first names OK (Mirek, Nadja, Gregor). Single surnames ending in -ov, -ev, -ec, -ic. No patronymic.
- **Workers:** Diminutive first names used as legal names (Tomek, Mila, Ivka). Short occupational surnames (Kovac, Molnar, Rezek).
- **Unreliables (Block G):** Nicknames more common than legal names. Street names.

## SECTION 6: THE FOUR LAYERS OF TRUTH

### Layer 1 — Public Knowledge (Acts 1-2)
"The Pattern was revealed to the Founding Council after the Collapse. It is the natural law of civic harmony. The Collapse happened because humanity forgot the Pattern. The Council restored it."

### Layer 2 — The Manufactured Doctrine (Act 3, Days 13-18)
"The Pattern was WRITTEN by humans, not revealed. The Founding Council studied behavioral psychology and designed a control system. The seven violations aren't natural laws — they're engineered to make everyone permanently guilty of something."
- Discovered through: doctored audits, Council hypocrisy cases, the Resistanz pamphlet with Council-sourced ink
- This is where most dystopian stories stop. We go deeper.

### Layer 3 — The Justified Horror (Act 4, Days 20-25)
"The Collapse was REAL. 80 years ago, a genuine catastrophe (plague + famine + civil war) killed 60% of the population. The founding families survived by organizing. They wrote the Pattern because unchecked human behavior genuinely DID destroy civilization once. The Pattern may be authoritarian, but it was created by people who watched the world burn and decided 'never again.'"
- Discovered through: The Pact fragments found in evidence, the Confession Tape, Vesna/Sonja's testimony
- This is the COMPLICATED layer. The player can't dismiss the Council as purely evil. They had reasons.

### Layer 4 — The Original Sin (Act 5, Days 27-29)
"The Collapse wasn't natural. It was ENGINEERED. A faction within the founding families deliberately caused the catastrophe — poisoned grain stores, sabotaged infrastructure, assassinated moderate leaders — to create the crisis that justified their takeover. The Pattern isn't protection from the Collapse. It's the spoils of it."
- Discovered through: The Final Audit (meta-case), hidden pages of the Pact, Maksimilian Dragojevic's testimony (if earned)
- The Dragojevic family discovered this truth 15 years ago. That's why they tried to reform. That's why they were purged.

### The Pact
A physical document (like Silo's Pact) that only the sitting Council reads. Contains:
- The true history of the Collapse (including who caused it)
- The succession rules (7 founding families, hereditary seats)
- The "Continuity Protocols" — what to do if the Pattern fails
- A section called "The Necessity" — the founders' justification for the engineered Collapse, in their own words

Only the First Councilor has read the complete Pact. Others read selected sections. The Seventh Seat holder was traditionally the Pact's "keeper of conscience." When the Dragojevics were purged, that role was eliminated.

---

## SECTION 7: RECALIBRATION

### The Old Problem
If no one returns from "relocation," why would anyone believe rehabilitation works?

### The Solution
Some people DO come back. That's worse.

### The System
When a citizen is convicted of a severe Deviation, they are sentenced to "Recalibration." After weeks or months, some return. They are quiet, compliant, productive. They confirm: "I was unwell. Now I am well. The Pattern provides." Same flat tone. Same words. Every time.

Family and neighbors notice differences — a mole in the wrong place, a left-handed person now using their right hand, forgetting their daughter's name — explaining it away as "trauma from the process."

### The Four Layers of Recalibration (discovered across 30 days)

1. **Public belief (Acts 1-2):** Recalibration works. People come back better. The system is compassionate.
2. **The Changed Ones (Act 2-3):** Case files mention returned citizens who behave strangely. A wife says "he's different." He says all the right things. He just... isn't the same.
3. **The Replacements (Act 4):** Some "returnees" are not the same person. The state sends someone who looks similar enough, speaks the recalibration script, and is installed in their old life. The originals never came back.
4. **The Full Horror (Act 5):** Both methods are used. "R-type" (reconditioned — drugs, isolation, behavioral reprogramming) and "S-type" (substituted — replacement person). Even the enforcers don't always know which is which.

### Gameplay Opportunity
A secondary case in Act 3-4 could involve fingerprinting a "recalibrated" citizen and discovering the prints don't match the original file. The spectrograph could detect trace chemicals from the reconditioning process.

---

## SECTION 8: THE SONJA DRAGOJEVIC TWIST

The Dragojevic family was one of the 7 founding families who wrote the original Pact. 15 years ago, the Dragojevics attempted to reform the Pattern from within — they had discovered Layer 4 (the Collapse was engineered) and tried to expose it. The other 6 families declared them traitors and purged them.

Most Dragojevics were recalibrated. A few escaped. Sonja Dragojevic — daughter of the last Dragojevic patriarch — went underground as "Vesna Cernak."

### Narrative Payoff
- Maksimilian Dragojevic (Fifth Councilor) survived the purge by betraying his own family. He's Sonja's cousin. He sits in the Council knowing his family was destroyed — and that the Seventh Seat belongs to a line he helped erase.
- When the player discovers "Vesna" is actually a Dragojevic, her font changes from sans-serif to cursive mid-conversation.
- Her moral complexity: she's not just a freedom fighter — she may be restoring a dynasty. Does she want to destroy the system or reclaim her seat?

---

## SECTION 9: THE COUNCIL — DEEP MYSTERY

### What the Player Discovers Over 30 Days
- **Days 1-6:** The Council is mentioned but invisible. Just directives.
- **Days 7-12:** First hints Council members violate their own laws.
- **Days 13-19:** Council members are NAMED (via evidence, not directly). The player learns specific people run things.
- **Days 20-25:** The hereditary secret. The masks. The Pact's existence.
- **Days 27-29:** The full truth — the manufactured Collapse, the founding families' guilt.

---

## SECTION 10: 30-DAY CASE ARC WITH SYNOPSES

### Moral Dilemma Framework
- **All dilemmas resolve at the VERDICT** — the player always investigates fully; the moral choice is what they DO with the evidence
- **Act 1 (Days 1-6): Economic pressure** — "I need the money." Player feels good catching bad guys. System works. One seed case.
- **Act 2 (Days 7-12): System doubt** — "Is this really a crime?" Cases get morally ambiguous. First economic dilemma (medicine for Eli).
- **Act 3 (Days 13-19): Political pressure** — "The system is broken." Council corruption exposed. Social dilemma (friend vs. Council relative). Resistance contact.
- **Act 4 (Days 20-25): Personal stakes** — "Nothing I do matters." System punishes all choices. Marlo's name on a list. Overseer unmasked.
- **Act 5 (Days 27-30): Reckoning** — "Who am I now?" Player's history is the evidence. Endings branch.

---

### ACT 1: THE GOOD SOLDIER (Days 1-6)

**Theme:** The system works. You're doing important work. Cases are clear-cut. Bonuses are good. Family letters are warm. Newspaper celebrates you.

**Goal:** Build the conviction habit with zero guilt. Make the player feel competent and righteous. Plant ONE seed of doubt on Day 5.

---

#### Day 1 — "The Depot Theft" (Tutorial)
**Deviation:** Accumulation (§2) — Theft of state rations
**Suspects:**
- **Miroslav Zelnik** — Night security guard at Block C ration depot — GUILTY. Staged a break-in to steal three months of medical supplies. Selling them at the black market.
- **Josip Dragic** — Block F factory worker — INNOCENT. Was walking home from night shift, seen near the depot.

**Synopsis:** Medical supplies and food rations vanish from the Block C depot overnight. The "break-in" was staged — the lock was broken from inside. Access log shows guard Miroslav entered at 2:17 AM. He claims he was responding to the alarm, but the alarm system log shows it triggered at 2:45 AM — 28 minutes AFTER his badge scan. Josip was simply walking home and was seen near the loading dock.

**Investigation:** Evidence cards teach hotspot clicking (access log, alarm report). Interrogation teaches lie detection (Miroslav's "alarm response" story collapses against the timeline). Verdict teaches the slot system.

**Reward:** 75 base. No resistance angle. No moral weight.

**Family letter:** Lenka writes warmly about Eli's first day at school. "He told his friends his father catches criminals. He's so proud of you."

**Newspaper (Day 2):** "RATION DEPOT THIEF APPREHENDED — Bureau Analysis Praised. Security Guard Zelnik Confesses."

---

#### Day 2 — "The Queue Brawl"
**Deviation:** Agitation (§5) — Public disturbance
**Suspects:**
- **Marko Jovic** — Brickyard worker — GUILTY (primary aggressor, struck first)
- **Stevo Lukic** — Cannery worker — GUILTY (secondary — cut the line, fought back, lied about Marko being drunk)

**Synopsis:** Two workers brawled at the Block D ration queue. Three witnesses give conflicting accounts. Stevo cut the line because his wife is pregnant; Marko shoved him first; Stevo threw a punch back and then lied that Marko was drunk. Medical reports show Marko struck first. The queue log disproves the "drunk" claim — Marko bought standard rations, no alcohol.

**Investigation:** First case with deliberately conflicting testimony. Player must cross-reference witness statements against physical evidence (medical report, queue log) to find the truth.

**Reward:** 70 base. No resistance angle. Clear-cut violence — both guilty, but Marko is the primary aggressor.

**Family letter:** Lenka: routine, warm. Mentions she ran into Marta Rezek at the market. "She always has the best dried apricots."

**Newspaper (Day 3):** "RATION QUEUE DISRUPTION RESOLVED — Two Workers Sentenced for Agitation."

---

#### Day 3 — "The False Accuser"
**Deviation:** Discontent (§4) — Filing a malicious report
**Suspects:**
- **Nadia Filipovic** — Postal clerk — GUILTY. Filed a false noise complaint against her neighbor who received a promotion she wanted.
- **Petar Simic** — Water treatment worker — INNOCENT (the accused).

**Synopsis:** Nadia filed three noise complaints against Petar, who just received a modest promotion she'd also applied for. Building records show zero corroborating noise violations. Two of the three alleged dates, Petar wasn't even home — he was on overnight shift. Investigation reveals Nadia is the actual Pattern violator: Discontent (envying another's allocation).

**Investigation:** The satisfying twist — the accuser IS the criminal. Player catches it by checking alibi records against complaint dates. The system CAN catch people who weaponize it.

**Reward:** 70 base. No resistance angle. Player feels clever.

**Family letter:** Lenka: "Your supervisor sent a nice note home with Eli's school report. He said Eli is 'a credit to his family.' I think they know what you do, Marlo."

**Newspaper (Day 4):** "MALICIOUS COMPLAINT EXPOSED — Postal Clerk Charged with Discontent Deviation."

---

#### Day 4 — "The Warehouse Ring"
**Deviation:** Accumulation (§2) — Theft of state materials
**Suspects:**
- **Dragan Todorovic** — Sector 9 warehouse clerk — GUILTY. Has been systematically stealing copper wire and factory tools, selling them through a black market contact.
- **Nikola Horvat** — Delivery driver — INNOCENT. His delivery routes happened to overlap with the theft dates, making him look suspicious. Alibi checks out — he was loading at the other end of the district.

**Synopsis:** Factory materials (copper wire, precision tools) have been disappearing from a Sector 9 warehouse for weeks. Delivery logs show Nikola's truck was at the dock on 4 of 6 theft dates — suspicious. But the warehouse inventory access log shows Dragan signed out the specific storage crates that were emptied. His apartment search reveals 2,400 marks in hidden cash — far above a clerk's salary. Nikola's alibi for the other 2 dates is airtight: loading receipts from the opposite end of the district with timestamps.

**Investigation:** Teaches careful evidence cross-referencing. The obvious suspect (delivery driver with access) is innocent; the quiet clerk with the keys is guilty. Classic misdirection solved by physical evidence.

**Reward:** 80 base. No resistance angle. Player feels like a real detective.

**Family letter:** Lenka: "Eli asked if you caught any bad guys today. I said every day. He cheered."

**Newspaper (Day 5):** "FACTORY THEFT RING DISMANTLED — Bureau Recovers 2,400 Marks in Stolen Goods."

**Overseer note (evening):** "Four for four, Analyst Dashev. The Council notices efficiency. Stay in the trace." — V. Terzic

---

#### Day 5 — "The Hoarder's Daughter" (THE SEED)
**Deviation:** Surplus (§1) — Consuming beyond allocated means
**Suspects:**
- **Tomasz Babic** — Factory worker — GUILTY. Hoarded three weeks of extra rations.
- **Ivana Kovac** — Neighbor / building monitor — INNOCENT (witness who reported him).

**Synopsis:** Receipts show Tomasz purchased extra rations under two different family cards. Apartment search confirms stockpiles of food and medicine. The evidence is clear and overwhelming. He doesn't deny it.

**THE SEED:** Tomasz has a daughter, Mila, with a chronic respiratory illness. State clinics won't treat conditions they classify as "non-emergency." He doesn't lie. He doesn't apologize. He says: "She needs twice the food because the medicine makes her sick. Show me the form where I apply for that. There isn't one."

**Investigation:** The evidence is so clear it's almost too easy. The moral weight is entirely in the interrogation — the player hears Tomasz's story and then must still convict. The law is the law.

**Reward:** 65 base. No resistance angle.

**Family letter (evening):** Lenka: "Eli's cough hasn't gone away. The clinic says it's nothing, just the weather. I worry anyway. A mother's job."

**Newspaper (Day 6):** "EXCESS RATIONS SEIZED IN BLOCK D — Worker Sentenced for Surplus Deviation."

**Why this works as the seed:** The player has spent 4 days feeling competent and righteous. Day 5 is the first time conviction feels... wrong. Not because the evidence is unclear — it's crystal clear. But because the system doesn't have a form for "my daughter is dying." And Lenka just mentioned Eli's cough. The parallel is planted. It won't bloom until Act 2.

---

#### Day 6 — CARRY-OVER DAY (No new core case)
- Newspaper shows Day 5 results
- **Overseer commendation:** "Excellent first week, Analyst Dashev. Five cases, five convictions. Your efficiency rating is among the highest in the Bureau this quarter. The Pattern provides." — V. Terzic
- **Family letter:** Lenka mentions Pyotr visited. "He seemed distracted. He wouldn't say why. He left a book for you — poetry, he said. I put it on your shelf."
- **Secondary case available:** Any unfinished secondary cases from the week can be processed today.
- Player feels: accomplished, rewarded, confident. The system works. Week 2 will be more of the same... right?

---

### ACT 2: CRACKS IN THE PATTERN (Days 7-12)

**Theme:** Cases get murkier. The "correct" verdict starts feeling wrong. System feels unjust but following it is still rewarded. First economic dilemma.

**Goal:** Introduce moral discomfort. The player should start second-guessing verdicts. Lenka's letters shift from warm to worried.

---

#### Day 7 — "The Ambitious Teacher"
**Deviation:** Elevation (§6) — Self-promotion beyond station
**Suspects (3):**
- **Katarina Novak** — Schoolteacher — GUILTY (bypassed the Talent Review Board to apply for coordinator)
- **Anton Zoric** — Schoolteacher — INNOCENT (reported her out of jealousy — he also applied and was rejected)
- **Board Secretary Dunja Lazic** — Bureau administrator — UNCHARGED (guilty of dereliction — she was supposed to convene the Talent Review Board but hasn't for 14 months)

**Synopsis:** Katarina applied directly for a coordinator position, bypassing the Council's Talent Review Board. Her colleague Anton reported her. But investigation reveals the Board hasn't convened in 14 months. Board Secretary Dunja Lazic has been collecting her salary while the entire promotion process sat frozen. Katarina broke a rule that is operationally impossible to satisfy.

**Eureka moment (interrogation):** When interrogated, Dunja Lazic confidently says "All promotion requests go through the proper Board process." When confronted with the 14-month gap, she stammers: "The Board... meets when there are qualified candidates." Katarina's application IS a qualified candidate. Dunja's own neglect created the impossible situation.

**Feel:** First case where the "correct" verdict is clearly morally wrong. Excellence is punishable. The system rewards mediocrity. AND the person most responsible (Dunja) faces no charges.

**Reward:** 80 base. Player starts earning but feels it.

---

#### Day 8 — "The Librarian's Books"
**Deviation:** Accumulation (§2) — Possessing banned materials
**Suspects:**
- **Luka Kolar** — State librarian — GUILTY
- **Vesna Tomic** — Retired seamstress — INNOCENT (neighbor who saw candlelight)

**Synopsis:** 14 banned pre-Collapse philosophy books found behind a false panel in a librarian's apartment. Fingerprints confirm he handled them. His crime is wanting to think. He asks directly: "Have you ever read Plato, analyst?"

**Feel:** Knowledge as crime. The books are Plato, Descartes, Marcus Aurelius — not bomb manuals.

**Reward:** 85 base.

---

#### Day 9 — "The Unregistered Couple"
**Deviation:** Deviance (§7) — Unregistered social bond
**Suspects:**
- **Ana Vidovic** — Clinic receptionist — GUILTY
- **Dragan Lazic** — Postal worker — GUILTY

**Synopsis:** Two citizens from different Blocks in an unregistered romantic relationship for eight months. Cross-block registration takes six months and is routinely denied. Dragan tried to register — the clerk laughed at him. A love letter intercepted in mail review proves the relationship.

**Feel:** Love itself is a crime. Most emotionally naked case in Act 2. Dragan's plea: "Don't separate us."

**Reward:** 75 base.

**Family letter:** Lenka: "Eli's cough is worse. I took him to the clinic — they said come back in two weeks. Two weeks, Marlo. Can you ask Dr. Petrovic if she knows anyone who could see him sooner?"

---

#### Day 10 — "The Medicine Dilemma"
**Deviation:** Surplus (§1) — Diverting medical supplies
**Suspects (4):**
- **Bogdan Zelnik** — Factory clinic orderly — GUILTY (primary). Diverted medical supplies from the factory clinic to sell at inflated black market prices.
- **Daria Petrovic** — Factory clinic administrator — GUILTY (cover-up). Falsified inventory records to hide the shortages.
- **Dr. Mirek Savic** — Factory clinic physician — INNOCENT but complicit. Prescribed unnecessary treatments to inflate demand for the medications Bogdan was stealing. He gets a cut.
- **Ivana Dragic** — Delivery driver — INNOCENT. Her delivery manifest has a timing discrepancy that looks suspicious, but she was simply delayed by a checkpoint.

**Synopsis:** Medical supplies — including respiratory medication — are disappearing from the Sector 9 factory clinic. Four people had access. Investigation reveals a chain: Dr. Savic over-prescribed medications to boost official inventory orders; Bogdan diverted the "surplus" orders to his black market contact; Daria altered the inventory logs. Ivana's delivery routes look suspicious but her checkpoint delay receipts check out.

**Eureka moment (forensic):** The spectrograph reveals that the "expired" medication listed on Daria's disposal reports contains the EXACT same batch numbers as black market pills seized by enforcers last week. The medication was never expired — it was relabeled and sold. The disposal reports are fiction.

**THE DILEMMA:** The state wants Bogdan convicted (the thief — clean case). Convicting Bogdan earns 90 base + 45 extraRewardForState = **135 total.** Going deeper to implicate Dr. Savic (a state-employed physician — embarrassing) earns only 90 base. **Lenka's Day 9 letter mentioned Eli's worsening cough. The medicine Eli needs costs 50 marks.** With the state bonus (135), Marlo can afford it plus bills. Without (90), it's tight — medicine OR food, not both.

**The emotional mechanics:** The player KNOWS Bogdan is the primary criminal. Convicting him is the right call AND the state-preferred call AND the financially necessary call. There is no moral cost... except the player now notices the system is aligning "correct" with "profitable." This is how complicity begins — not with a terrible choice, but with a convenient one.

**Reward:** 90 base + 45 state bonus. The state bonus IS the medicine money.

**Newspaper (Day 11):** "MEDICAL SUPPLY THIEF SENTENCED — Factory Clinic Security Tightened."

---

#### Day 11 — "The Silenced Inspector"
**Deviation:** Discontent (§4) — Fabricated charge
**Suspects:**
- **Henrik Petrov** — Factory safety inspector — INNOCENT (charge is fabricated)
- **Mila Babic** — Factory director — NOT CHARGED (guilty of cover-up)

**Synopsis:** A safety inspector documented real hazards: cracked ventilation, expired chemical filters, two unreported worker injuries. The factory director charged HIM with Discontent — "questioning the Council's allocation of safety resources." The evidence fully supports Henrik's findings.

**Feel:** The pivot case. The player is now asked to convict someone they can prove is innocent. Director Babic filed the charge to discredit Henrik before his report reached the District Office. Convicting Henrik is a conscious submission to the system.

**Reward:** 85 base + 40 state bonus for convicting Henrik. Standard 85 for clearing him.

**Family letter:** Lenka: "Marlo, a woman from the Bureau visited today. She said it was a 'routine loyalty wellness check.' She asked about our family, our friends, whether anyone visits. Eli was there. He was frightened. What is this about?"

---

#### Day 12 — CARRY-OVER DAY
- Newspaper shows results. If the player has been making moral choices, an Overseer letter shifts tone: "Your analysis has been... inconsistent, Dashev. I trust this is a temporary fluctuation."
- Lenka: "Pyotr came for dinner. He was quiet. He wouldn't eat. When the children went to bed, he asked me to tell you something: 'The ink is the same.' He wouldn't explain. Marlo, what does he mean?"
- This cryptic message from Pyotr plants a seed for the pamphlet case in Act 3 (the ink on Resistance pamphlets matches Council-grade stock).

---

### ACT 3: THE CORRUPTION (Days 13-18)

**Theme:** Council corruption exposed. Cases actively reveal systemic rot. Overseer pressure intensifies. Resistance makes first contact. Social dilemma (friend vs. Council relative).

**Goal:** Force active moral decisions. Passive compliance is no longer comfortable. Zero-reward moral options appear for the first time.

---

#### Day 13 — "The Dead Witness" (HOMICIDE)
**Deviation:** Agitation (§5) — Homicide / Dereliction (§3) — Obstruction of investigation
**Suspects (4):**
- **Enforcer Sergeant Denic** — The officer who "found" Borislav's body at the bottom of a factory stairwell — GUILTY. Forensic evidence contradicts his account. He was ordered to silence Borislav before he could testify about Council financial fraud (connects to Day 16's accountant case).
- **Milena Jovic** — Records clerk who processed Borislav's relocation papers THREE DAYS before his death — COMPLICIT. She filed the papers early, creating a paper trail that would make his death look like a post-relocation incident. She won't speak: "I have children, analyst."
- **Factory Foreman Branko Simic** — Borislav's supervisor — INNOCENT. Had a workplace dispute with Borislav but was at a production meeting with 12 witnesses at the time of death.
- **Nikola Radic** — A fellow worker who owed Borislav gambling debts — INNOCENT (red herring). Has motive but his alibi is airtight.

**Synopsis:** Borislav Filipovic — a key witness in a prior case — is dead. Official report: fell down a factory stairwell. The Bureau assigns it to Marlo as a "workplace accident" investigation. But the autopsy report shows injuries inconsistent with a fall: defensive wounds on his arms, a blow to the back of the head BEFORE the fall. His relocation papers were already filed — the system was erasing him before he was even dead.

**Eureka moment (forensic):** Fingerprint analysis on the stairwell railing reveals Sergeant Denic's prints on the INSIDE of the railing — exactly where someone pushing another person would grip. Denic claims he grabbed the railing while "trying to help." But the angle is wrong: his prints face downward (pushing), not upward (pulling). The physical evidence proves murder.

**A Resistance symbol (the broken circle) and a radio frequency are hidden in Borislav's personal effects** — he was about to defect.

**Feel:** THE ESCALATION. Act 3 opens with murder. The system doesn't just convict people unfairly — it kills them. First case where the player investigates a serious violent crime.

**Resistance involved:** Yes — Borislav was about to join the Resistance when he was silenced.
**Reward:** 90 base + 55 state bonus for ruling it an "accident." 90 base for ruling it homicide.

---

#### Day 14 — "The Party Photographs" (ESPIONAGE)
**Deviation:** Surplus (§1) real / Accumulation (§2) charged / Dereliction (§3) — espionage
**Suspects (3):**
- **Jovan Rezek** — Freelance repairman — GUILTY of taking the photos, but innocent of the charged crime. He was hired to fix a chandelier and couldn't resist photographing the obscene excess.
- **Council Aide Vera Kolar** — UNCHARGED publicly — but she is the one who anonymously submitted the photos to the Bureau. She is secretly working for the Fourth Councilor (Vitomir Zoroslav, Information) to build a case against the THIRD Councilor (Radovanovic). Council infighting.
- **Lieutenant Josip Matic** — Council security — INNOCENT of the photo leak but guilty of accepting bribes to let unauthorized people into Council events. He let Jovan in for 50 marks.

**Synopsis:** Photographs of a Council banquet — imported wine, luxury food, items that would earn any citizen a Surplus charge — were anonymously submitted to the Bureau. The Bureau arrested the repairman who had building access. But WHO submitted the photos, and WHY?

**Eureka moment (forensic + interrogation):** The photos were printed on Bureau-quality paper — not consumer stock. This means someone with Bureau access printed them. Vera Kolar's fingerprints are on the envelope. When confronted, she doesn't deny it. She says, with elite composure: "The Third Councilor's... excesses are a concern to certain parties. I was asked to ensure documentation reached the appropriate hands." She won't say who asked her. But the Fourth Councilor's seal appears on an unrelated memo in Vera's desk — connecting the dots. The Council is eating itself.

**Overseer note:** "Focus on the photographer, not the subject, Dashev. And certainly not on who delivered the envelope."

**Feel:** First hint of Council internal warfare. The corruption isn't monolithic — factions are using the Bureau as a weapon against each other. Jovan is caught in the middle. He says: "You know this is wrong. But you'll convict me anyway, won't you?"

**Reward:** 95 base + 50 state bonus for convicting Jovan. Standard 95 for following the deeper thread.

---

#### Day 15 — "The Old Friend"
**Deviation:** Accumulation (§2) — Diverting state construction funds
**Suspects (4):**
- **Tomek Radin** — Construction foreman, Marlo's old friend from his teaching days — Evidence is moderate. Had access to the project funds. His signature is on 3 of the 7 diverted payment orders. But his motive is thin — he lives modestly.
- **Danilo Radovanovic** — Nephew of Third Councilor Radovanovic — Evidence is stronger. Direct access to the accounts, suspicious transfers to an unlisted account, and an unexplained 3,000-mark deposit in his personal savings.
- **Accountant Maja Cerovic** — Project accountant who processed ALL the payment orders — Evidence is circumstantial. She processed the paperwork but claims she was "just following instructions." Her handwriting appears on correction notes on 5 of the 7 diverted orders.
- **Site Inspector Goran Lazic** — Council-appointed inspector who approved the inflated costs — INNOCENT but negligent. He rubber-stamped every invoice without site visits.

**Synopsis:** 47,000 marks in state construction funds for a Block D housing project have been diverted through inflated material costs and phantom labor charges. Four people had access to the payment chain. Tomek Radin is Marlo's old friend — the man who recommended Marlo for the Bureau job. His wife knows Lenka. Their children have played together. Danilo Radovanovic is the nephew of the Third Councilor.

**Eureka moment (interrogation):** When interrogated separately, Tomek and Danilo each blame the other. But Maja Cerovic — the quiet accountant — lets something slip under stress: "I corrected the numbers because HE told me to." When asked which "he," she freezes. If the player has discovered a specific clue (Danilo's personal bank deposit receipt, found on the desk evidence), they can press: the correction notes on the payment orders are in Maja's handwriting, but the INSTRUCTIONS were verbal — from Danilo. Tomek's signatures were on early orders before the fraud began; he signed legitimate payments that were later altered.

**THE DILEMMA:** Evidence against Danilo is strongest when all pieces connect. But the Overseer's note is pointed: "Some trees have deeper roots than others, Dashev. Be very careful which one you uproot."

Convicting Tomek (the friend): Reward = 90 base + 60 state bonus = 150. Marlo's friend goes to Recalibration. Lenka's next letter: "Tomek's wife came to the door today. She didn't say anything. She just looked at me and left."

Convicting Danilo (the nephew): Reward = 90 base only. Council Favor drops sharply. The Third Councilor retaliates.

**The emotional knife:** Marlo loses the friendship regardless. The choice is: which friendship does Marlo betray — the one to his friend, or the one to the truth?

**Reward:** 90 base + 60 state bonus for the friend. 90 base for the nephew.

---

#### Day 16 — "The Accountant's Numbers"
**Deviation:** Discontent (§4) / Accumulation (§2)
**Suspects:**
- **Sonja Petrovic** — Government accountant — INNOCENT (charge is retaliatory)
- **Director Goran Lukic** — NOT CHARGED (guilty of fund diversion)

**Synopsis:** Accountant discovered 47,000 marks diverted from Block D infrastructure to an unlisted account. She filed an internal report. Two weeks later she was charged with Discontent and Accumulation. The records include the name "P. Radin" — Pyotr, Lenka's brother.

**Feel:** Whistleblower is the suspect. Pyotr's name connects the political arc to Marlo's family.

**Reward:** 90 base. Resistance involved — the diverted funds trace to Councilor Radovanovic.

---

#### Day 17 — "The Councilor's Nephew"
**Deviation:** Accumulation (§2) — Theft of medical supplies
**Suspects:**
- **Danilo Radovanovic** (if acquitted on Day 15, he appears again; if convicted, a different relative: **Filip Radovanovic**, a cousin)
- **Pavel Zoric** — Security guard — INNOCENT (witness)

**Synopsis:** Three crates of medical supplies stolen from a government depot. Security camera and witness statement identify a Radovanovic family member. Overseer offers an explicit reassignment bonus: **150 marks** to make the case disappear. Danilo/Filip's arrogance: "My uncle will sort this out."

**Feel:** First direct financial bribe from the system. 150 marks is enormous — that's nearly a week of survival.

**Reward:** 100 base + 150 bribe for dropping it. 100 base for prosecution.

---

#### Day 18 — "The Falsified Audit"
**Deviation:** Dereliction (§3) / Accumulation (§2)
**Suspects:**
- **Branimir Tomic** — Senior finance clerk — GUILTY (of altering documents)
- **Auditor Maja Horvat** — INNOCENT

**Synopsis:** Two versions of the same Block D Infrastructure Fund report exist. Fingerprint analysis places Branimir on the altered document. All 12 changes benefit the same unlisted account. Branimir's admission: "I was instructed to make those adjustments. By my superiors."

**Feel:** Concrete proof of systematic Council financial fraud. The altered documents trace directly to Councilor Radovanovic.

**Reward:** 95 base. Resistance involved.

---

#### Day 19 — CARRY-OVER DAY
- Overseer note escalates: "Dashev, you have been making choices that suggest a pattern of your own. I would hate to see your family's housing allocation reviewed."
- Lenka: "A man followed me home from the market today. He didn't say anything. He just walked behind me for six blocks. Marlo, please — whatever is happening at the Bureau, be careful."
- Newspaper: "COUNCIL REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO BLOCK D INFRASTRUCTURE" (propaganda contradicting the player's evidence)

---

### ACT 4: THE RECKONING (Days 20-25)

**Theme:** Everything escalates. Personal stakes maximum. System cracking. No more fence-sitting.

**Goal:** Urgency and guilt. The player should feel the weight of every previous decision. Cases become explicitly political.

---

#### Day 20 — "The False Flag" (TERRORISM)
**Deviation:** Agitation (§5) — Bombing / Accumulation (§2) — Explosives possession
**Suspects (4):**
- **Tomas Simic** — Bookshop worker / Resistance sympathizer — INNOCENT (framed). Was seen near the building earlier that day buying books — his shop is next door. Arrested within hours.
- **Captain Dusan Kovac** — Military Council liaison — GUILTY (orchestrated the false flag). His clearance badge was used at 2:30 AM.
- **Corporal Zeljko Markovic** — Military demolitions specialist — COMPLICIT. He built the device under Kovac's orders. His fingerprints are on the detonator components.
- **Janitor Srdjan Babic** — Night janitor at the building — INNOCENT witness. He left at midnight as usual. He heard nothing because the bomb was planted AFTER his shift — he's a red herring based on building access.

**Synopsis:** A bomb detonated in a government administrative building at 3:07 AM (empty, no casualties — by design). Within hours, the Council blamed the Resistance and arrested Tomas Simic, whose bookshop is next door. State media runs the story immediately — suspiciously fast, with pre-written headlines.

**Eureka moment (forensic — spectrograph + fingerprints):** The spectrograph reveals the explosive compound is **RDX-4** — military-grade, manufactured exclusively at the Council's Sector 7 armory. No civilian could acquire it. Fingerprints on detonator components don't match Tomas but DO match Corporal Markovic, a demolitions specialist stationed at — Sector 7 armory. When confronted, Markovic breaks: "I was told it was a training exercise. Captain Kovac said it was authorized." The security log confirms Kovac's badge at 2:30 AM. The bomb was planted by the military and blamed on a bookseller.

**Feel:** The Council bombed its own building. The pre-written headlines prove they PLANNED the narrative before the explosion. Tomas's innocence is fully provable. Convicting him is entirely conscious collaboration with state terrorism.

**Reward:** 100 base + 80 state bonus for convicting Tomas. Standard 100 for following evidence to Kovac.

---

#### Day 21 — "The Poisoned Well" (POISONING)
**Deviation:** Agitation (§5) — Mass endangerment / Accumulation (§2) — Possession of restricted chemicals
**Suspects (4):**
- **Maintenance Worker Vladan Stojic** — Water treatment plant worker for Block D — GUILTY (directly contaminated the water supply). His tool locker contains the same chemical compound found in the water.
- **Dr. Natalija Savic** — Block D clinic physician — INNOCENT. She was the first to report the poisoning symptoms to the Bureau. She is now a suspect because the chemicals are medical-grade — the system suspects its own whistleblower.
- **Chemist Filip Todorovic** — Pharmaceutical plant worker — COMPLICIT. He supplied the chemicals to Vladan, believing they were for "pest control." His access log at the pharmaceutical plant shows he signed out 3 liters of a restricted sedative compound.
- **Unknown "Handler"** — Referenced in a note found in Vladan's locker: "Apply at midnight. Concentration per instructions. Payment upon confirmation." Unsigned.

**Synopsis:** Twelve citizens in Block D are hospitalized with neurological symptoms — tremors, confusion, memory gaps. Water testing reveals contamination with a chemical compound. The Bureau assigns it as an Agitation case (public endangerment), not attempted murder.

**Eureka moment (forensic — spectrograph):** The spectrograph analysis reveals the contaminant is **Compound 7-R** — the EXACT same chemical cocktail used in the Recalibration process. This is not a random poisoning. Someone used Recalibration drugs in the water supply. The player now has physical evidence that Recalibration involves chemical manipulation — connecting to Recalibration's true nature (Section 7). Dr. Savic recognizes the symptoms because she has treated "recalibrated" returnees before: "These symptoms... I've seen them. In patients who came back from rehabilitation. The same tremors. The same confusion."

**The deeper question:** Was this a test? A punishment? A deliberate preview of what Recalibration does to people? The handler's note suggests this was ORDERED, not freelance. The Council may be testing chemical dosages on Block D residents.

**Resistance angle:** A coded message appears in Marlo's case file (delivered as if it were a misplaced evidence tag): "Now you see what they do behind closed doors. — V.C." The Resistance directly addresses Marlo for the first time.

**Feel:** The game shifts from white-collar crime to mass poisoning. Block D — the same Block that's been starved, whose infrastructure funds were stolen, whose children are in the orphanage — is now being poisoned. The system isn't just unfair; it's actively attacking its own citizens.

**Reward:** 100 base + state bonus for blaming "contaminated pipes" (an accident, no perpetrator). Standard 100 for following the chemical trail.

---

#### Day 22 — "The Purge List"
**Deviation:** Dereliction (§3) — Failing to process paperwork
**Suspects (3):**
- **Stefan Novak** — Administrative clerk — GUILTY (of deliberately delaying processing). He recognized names on the list — teachers, a market vendor, a nurse — and stalled for 11 days.
- **Director Ivana Babic** — Stefan's superior — UNCHARGED. She signed the original order and expedited it when the delay was discovered. "Processing efficiency is my responsibility, analyst. Not the content."
- **Courier Dragan Simic** — The courier who was supposed to deliver the list to the Recalibration facility — INNOCENT. He never received it because Stefan intercepted it.

**Synopsis:** A clerk charged with failing to process a "relocation" list of 47 citizens on time. He delayed it 11 days by misfiling it as "pending verification."

**Eureka moment (evidence):** Among the 47 names on the list, the player discovers **"DASHEV, M." — crossed out with the annotation "retain — still useful."** Marlo's own name was on a purge list. He is alive because someone decided he was useful, not because he is safe. Further examination reveals that THREE other names have similar annotations: "retain — family leverage," "retain — informant," "retain — compliant." The Council doesn't just kill — it sorts people into categories: useful, expendable, and leverage.

**Feel:** The most personally threatening moment in the game. Stefan asks: "What will you do, analyst? While your own name is on the page?"

**Reward:** 100 base. Convicting Stefan means 47 people are processed for Recalibration.

---

#### Day 23 — "The Assassination" (ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT)
**Deviation:** Agitation (§5) — Attempted murder / Dereliction (§3) — Dereliction of security duties
**Suspects (4):**
- **Alena Filipovic** — Former university student, known Resistance operative — PRIMARY SUSPECT. Found near the scene with ink-stained hands (she was distributing pamphlets, not shooting). Has motive against the Council.
- **Sergeant Rade Petrovic** — Council bodyguard assigned to protect the target — COMPLICIT. He "stepped away" from his post for 90 seconds during the attack. His bank records show a 500-mark deposit from an unlisted account the same morning.
- **Private Milo Djordjevic** — A young soldier on perimeter security — INNOCENT. He heard the shot, ran toward it, and is being scapegoated for "failure to prevent." He's 19 years old and terrified.
- **The Weapon** — A Council-issued military pistol, serial number filed off. But the filing is incomplete — 4 digits remain visible. Cross-referencing the armory log reveals who it was issued to.

**Synopsis:** An assassination attempt on the Fifth Councilor — Maksimilian Dragojevic — outside the Council Hall. A single shot fired from a building across the street. It missed. The Council immediately arrested Alena (a known Resistance member who was distributing pamphlets three blocks away) and Private Djordjevic (the nearest guard).

**Eureka moment (forensic — fingerprints + cross-reference):** The remaining serial number digits on the weapon match a batch issued exclusively to the Third Councilor's personal security detail — Sergeant Petrovic's unit. Fingerprints on the weapon match NO suspect in custody. They match a set in the Bureau's own "inactive" personnel file — a name Marlo has never seen: **Agent Zelimir Terzic.** A relative of Overseer V. Terzic. The assassination was ordered from WITHIN the Council — the Third Councilor (Radovanovic) attempting to eliminate the Fifth Councilor (the last Dragojevic on the Council).

**The deeper layer:** Why kill Maksimilian? Because he has been quietly corresponding with the Resistance. He betrayed his family 15 years ago but has been consumed by guilt. He was about to reveal the truth about the Dragojevic purge. Radovanovic found out and ordered the hit.

**Feel:** Council civil war becomes physical violence. The assassination connects to Sonja Dragojevic's story — someone tried to kill her cousin, the man who betrayed her family. Is she relieved or horrified? The political intrigue reaches its violent climax.

**Reward:** 100 base + large state bonus for convicting Alena (the Resistance operative). Standard 100 for following the weapon to the Council's own armory.

---

#### Day 24 — "The Overseer Unmasked"
**Deviation:** Accumulation (§2) / Dereliction (§3) — Espionage, unauthorized document retention
**Suspects (3):**
- **Ivan Tomic** — Bureau filing clerk — GUILTY (retained 14 classified memos over 6 months). A quiet man who has been systematically copying and hiding documents he knows will be destroyed.
- **Analyst Milena Stojakovic** — A fellow Bureau analyst — INNOCENT. Her name appears on two of the memos as "flagged for review" — she's being set up as a secondary target.
- **Colonel Vlastimir Terzic ("V. Terzic")** — NOT PRESENT, NOT CHARGED — but his identity is the discovery. The man behind the curtain.

**Synopsis:** A filing clerk is charged with retaining classified memos. Routine case — until Marlo reads the memos themselves.

**Eureka moment (evidence — the most personal in the game):** The memos contain Marlo's complete case assignment history with annotations:
- Day 1: "Assign Depot Theft. Straightforward. Build confidence."
- Day 5: "Assign Babic ration case. Observe emotional response. If sympathetic, flag for management."
- Day 10: "Assign medicine case. Ensure state-preferred outcome aligns with personal incentive. Test compliance under economic pressure."
- Day 15: "Assign Radin case. Personal connection. Observe loyalty threshold."

Every case, every commendation, every "guidance" letter — was part of a program. Fingerprints on the original routing memos match **Colonel Vlastimir Terzic, Military Intelligence** — the same man who signed himself "V. Terzic" on every Overseer letter since Day 1. Marlo was labeled "manageable" in the Day 1 memo. Ivan says: "I kept copies because I knew the originals would disappear. Just like Borislav."

**Feel:** The ultimate betrayal. The player's entire experience has been stage-managed. Every feeling of competence in Act 1, every dilemma in Act 2-3 — designed. The player isn't just Marlo realizing he's been manipulated; the PLAYER realizes they've been manipulated.

**Reward:** 100 base. Convicting Ivan protects Terzic's identity and the manipulation program.

---

#### Day 25 — "The Confession Tape"
**Deviation:** Accumulation (§2) — Possessing classified recordings
**Suspects:**
- **Andrej Radin** — Courier / student — GUILTY of possession. (Note: surname "Radin" — Pyotr's last name. He's connected to Marlo's extended family network.)

**Synopsis:** A disc recovered from a Resistance safe house contains a 40-year-old audio recording of Founding Council members designing the Pattern. They explicitly discuss which human behaviors to criminalize, how to frame them as moral failings, and how to ensure every citizen is perpetually guilty. One voice calls the Pattern "a useful fiction." The disc belonged to Vesna/Sonja's grandmother — a Founding Council member who recorded it as insurance.

**Feel:** THE central revelation. The Pattern was engineered in a conference room. Andrej tells Marlo: "Vesna said to tell you: 'I think she meant you to hear it.'"

**Computer tool required** to play the recording. The player listens to the founders calmly discussing how to design permanent guilt.

**Reward:** 100 base.

---

#### Day 26 — CARRY-OVER DAY
- Newspaper: "COUNCIL EMERGENCY SESSION," "CURFEW EXTENDED CITYWIDE"
- Lenka: "Marlo, Pyotr didn't come home last night. The children keep asking where Uncle Pyotr is. I don't know what to tell them. Please come home safe."
- Overseer (Terzic) note — if his identity has been exposed: nothing. Silence. If still masked: "The Council is aware of certain irregularities in your recent analyses, Dashev. A review is forthcoming."

---

### ACT 5: THE CHOICE (Days 27-30)

**Theme:** What kind of person have you become? Final reckoning. Endings branch.

---

#### Day 27 — "The Vesna File"
**Deviation:** Multiple — player-determined
**Suspects:**
- **Vesna Cernak / Sonja Dragojevic** — Resistance leader — GUILTY of everything she's charged with

**Synopsis:** Vesna has been captured. Her case file arrives at Marlo's desk. The Council dossier: intimidation, property destruction, recruiting civilians into danger. The Resistance counter-dossier: protecting 23 families from relocation, exposing real corruption, preserving the Confession Tape.

**The Sonja reveal:** If the player has earned enough Resistance Trust, evidence in the file reveals "Vesna Cernak" is actually **Sonja Vlastimirova Dragojevic** — daughter of the last Dragojevic patriarch, heir to the Seventh Seat. Her font changes mid-conversation from sans-serif to cursive.

Her direct appeal: "You've seen your own name on a purge list. You've heard the tape. The question isn't whether I'm guilty. The question is: what does 'guilty' even mean in a system built on lies?"

**Feel:** Penultimate moral judgment. Both sides' evidence is genuine. She IS guilty of everything. So is the Council.

#### Day 28 — "The Final Audit"
**Deviation:** Meta — player chooses the frame
**Suspects:** The Council / The Resistance / Both / Neither

**Synopsis:** A directive arrives instructing Marlo to compile a final report on all cases processed during his tenure. Evidence available depends entirely on previous discoveries and verdicts. Verdict schema has custom slots: Subject, Finding (Corrupt/Justified/Complicit/Insufficient Evidence), Recommendation (Prosecution/Reform/Dissolution/No Action).

**Feel:** The player's entire history is the evidence. No two playthroughs produce the same audit.

#### Days 29-30 — Epilogue
- Day 29: Final verdict submitted. Branching based on Council Favor + Resistance Trust + Family status.
- Day 30: Newspaper. Family outcome. Ending scene.

## SECTION 11: ENDINGS

### Ending 1: The Loyal Analyst (High Council Favor, Low Resistance Trust)
Marlo convicts Vesna, earns a promotion, moves family to Block A. But Block D starves. Pyotr is recalibrated. A small newspaper article mentions "unrest in Block G" — the cycle continues.

### Ending 2: The Defector (Low Council Favor, High Resistance Trust)
Marlo exposes the Council. Vesna escapes. The Resistanz broadcasts the truth. But the Council retaliates — Marlo's family is relocated. Whether the revolution succeeds is left ambiguous.

### Ending 3: The Pragmatist (Moderate both)
Marlo plays both sides. Vesna is imprisoned but alive. Council weakened but standing. Marlo keeps his job with a new overseer. Lenka's letters suggest she knows what he did — and isn't sure she can live with it.

### Ending 4: The Whistleblower (High both — hardest to achieve)
Enough credibility with both sides to broker a deal. Presents evidence to Maksimilian Dragojevic (the Fifth Councilor who betrayed his family), forcing reform. Vesna agrees to work within the new system. Imperfect. But Block D gets full rations. Pyotr comes home.

### Ending 5: The Coward (Low both — worst ending)
Failed everyone. Demoted to filing clerk. Family moved to Block E. The cases he botched led to innocents convicted and guilty walking free. The final newspaper shows everything Marlo could have prevented.

## SECTION 12: SECONDARY CASES (10 — update names/terminology only)

The 10 secondary case briefs provide variety, income, and optional narrative threads. They remain as designed, with name/terminology updates:

1. **Broken Radio** (Day 2, Domestic) — Old man's broken radio causing noise. Poverty, not malice.
2. **Market Shoplifting** (Day 3, Petty Crime) — Desperate man steals dried fruit. Introduces Marta Rezek.
3. **Unauthorized Breaks** (Day 4, Workplace) — Worker with a medical condition taking bathroom breaks. System doesn't accommodate.
4. **Intercepted Love Letters** (Day 5, Romantic) — Two widowed citizens finding companionship. Echoes Day 9 core.
5. **Excessive Smiling** (Day 7, Absurd) — Dental hygienist charged with "persistent unjustified positive affect." Darkly funny.
6. **Jaywalking Courier** (Day 10, Connected) — Courier's route includes a Resistance safe house. Seeds Act 3.
7. **Fabricated Complaint** (Day 12, Informant) — Ex-husband weaponizes Pattern against ex-wife. Parallels Day 3 core.
8. **Contraband Soap** (Day 14, Economic) — Handmade soap with "restricted botanical" (lavender). Absurd contraband.
9. **Graffiti on Propaganda Poster** (Day 16, Youth) — 17-year-old drew glasses on a Councilor's face. System treats him as adult.
10. **Cold Case Clock** (Day 20, Historical) — 72-year-old retired janitor stole a clock 8 years ago because it reminded him of his wife. No statute of limitations.

## SECTION 13: RESEARCH INTEGRATION NOTES

**From Silo:** The Pact as a generational control document. Layered truth. Recalibration's false comfort.
**From Handmaid's Tale:** Ritual greetings. Class-based speech. The Reaffirmation Ceremony.
**From 1984:** Bureau abbreviations. Tiered surveillance. Council "doublethink."
**From Brazil:** The indictment form — tactilely satisfying but morally horrifying. A case where a typo leads to wrong arrest (secondary case opportunity).
**From The Lives of Others:** Marlo's empathy through surveillance. Zersetzung (psychological warfare) — how the Council handles difficult analysts.
**From We:** Glass buildings for Block A (live transparently). Recalibration's neurological component.
**From Equilibrium:** Emotions as crime — the Tenet of Composure. "Running hot" as worker slang. Chemical compliance — recalibration drugs.

## Appendix: Secondary Case Themes by Category

### Domestic Disputes
Neighbors feuding over noise, property lines, shared ration allocation. Often petty but reveal the pressure-cooker of communal living. Sometimes a domestic case masks something darker (abuse, illegal hoarding, forbidden relationships).

### Petty Crime
Shoplifting from the Market District, small-scale contraband (books, music, extra food), vandalism of propaganda posters. These cases should feel procedural and satisfying — clear evidence, straightforward verdicts.

### Workplace Violations
Quota dodging, unauthorized breaks, fraternization between workers of different clearance levels, using factory equipment for personal projects. These cases expose the dehumanizing nature of the work system.

### Romantic Complications
Secret relationships, love letters intercepted by informants, couples applying for marriage and being denied, affairs between citizens of different Blocks. The emotional core of the game — love as a crime.

### Absurd Bureaucracy
A citizen accused of "excessive smiling" in a government building. A report filed because someone's garden is "suspiciously well-maintained." A man charged with Discontent for saying "nice weather we're having" (implying the weather is usually bad, which implies dissatisfaction). These cases are darkly funny and critique the system.

### Connected Seeds
Minor offenses by characters who connect to the main arc. A jaywalking charge on someone who turns out to be a Resistanz courier. A noise complaint against an apartment where pamphlets are being printed. These cases reward attentive players who track details across days.

### Informant Cases
Cases brought by informants — anonymous tips that may be genuine or may be personal vendettas disguised as civic duty. The player must assess credibility.

### Economic Cases
Black market activity, counterfeit ration cards, under-the-table labor. These expose the economy's failures and the desperation of citizens.

### Youth Cases
Juveniles (16-18) charged with minor violations. These are intentionally uncomfortable — the system doesn't distinguish age.

### Historical Cases
Cold cases reopened. Old evidence, faded documents, witnesses who've forgotten or died. These are puzzles with limited information, forcing the player to work with what they have.

## Appendix: Mechanics Integration Notes

### How Story Affects Gameplay
- **Council Favor** affects: bonus pay, tool access timing, case complexity, Overseer tone
- **Resistance Trust** affects: hidden evidence availability, ally assistance, alternative solutions
- **Family status** affects: letter content, urgency, endgame options
- **Previous verdicts** affect: newspaper content, witness availability, Act 5 evidence access

### Case Generation Constraints
When generating cases, respect these narrative rules:
1. **Act 1 cases** should have clear-cut verdicts (one obviously guilty suspect)
2. **Act 2 cases** should have morally ambiguous verdicts (guilty but sympathetic)
3. **Act 3 cases** should have verdicts that conflict with Overseer directives
4. **Act 4 cases** should have multiple valid solutions with different faction impacts
5. **Act 5 cases** should reference previous case outcomes

### Naming Conventions
- **Citizens:** Eastern European names following class rules above. Common surnames: Kovac, Novak, Babic, Horvat, Jovic, Lazic, Radic, Lukic, Simic, Vidovic, Zoric, Kolar, Filipovic, Tomic, Petrov, Rezek, Sevorin, Radin, Dusek, Petrovic, Zelnik, Dragic, Todorovic, Stojic.
- **Locations:** Block + letter (A-G), Sector + number (0-9), specific landmarks (Market District, Factory Quarter, Relay Tower)
- **Case IDs:** `core_XX` or `secondary_XX` (zero-padded two digits)
- **Evidence IDs:** `ev_[descriptive_name]` (e.g., `ev_access_log`, `ev_alarm_report`)
- **Clue IDs:** `clue_[descriptive_name]` (e.g., `clue_badge_timestamp`, `clue_alarm_discrepancy`)
- **Citizen IDs:** `citizen_[firstname]` or `citizen_[firstname]_[lastname]` if common name
- **Deviations** are referenced by Tenet section: `§1` through `§7`

### Tone Guidelines
- **Bureaucratic:** Everything is official, documented, processed. Even horror is mundane.
- **Understated:** Characters don't monologue about oppression. They say things like "That's above my pay grade" and "I just process the paperwork."
- **Dark humor:** Absurd bureaucracy should occasionally be funny. A citizen accused of "excessive smiling" is both horrifying and absurd.
- **Personal:** Despite the systemic scope, every case should feel personal. Names, addresses, occupations — these are people, not statistics.
